This part from Amazon does seem to be the same factory certified part as described and the package says &#34;made in US&#34; which is nice. Very easy replacement.<br /><br />The coupler on our blender broke apart, that is, the hard, black rubber part broke apart and so only the metal core/insert remained on the blender. I read a few online instructions on replacement and then watched a few youtube videos showing the replacement. Instructions are included with this part and includes a few photos. removal of the old coupler is even easier than the youtube videos show.<br /><br />The coupler core appears to be made of aluminum and is screwed onto a hardened steel shaft. The instructions require you to insert a flat screw driver under the old coupler and just pry it up a few times, rotating your position until it comes off. Because the coupler core is aluminum, it's really just prying the threads up which give way to the harder steel. Once off, you remove any bits of aluminum threads that came off. Then simply screw the new coupler onto the threaded shaft. You can and just need to hand tighten it, counter clockwise. The normal blending motion/direction tightens the coupler further. It literally took me all of 90 seconds to complete the whole replacement.",8/31/15,NEUTRAL

About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.",8/31/15,POSITIVE

Long Review/ Story.,"Where do I begin? I received my brand new lil washer machine today. Couldn‚Äôt be more excited to do laundry! After 12 years of schlepping to the laundry mat, dodging cars to cross the street, counting pennies to convert to quarters,  I finally invested in my own private washing machine. I have to admit, this is my 3rd attempt at buying a portable washing machine in the last month. One of the main reasons why I made a decision to make this type of purchase is that the laundry-mat disgusts me. After 10+ years of going to the Ol coin op, I finally had it. I did a load of wash, and when it was done, I took my clothes out and everything was covered in Dog/ Cat hair. EVERYTHING was covered. IM highly allergic to dogs and cats and thankfully the laundry manager was there when this happened. She gave me quarters to re-wash my clothes. Unfortunately, the second wash didn‚Äôt get all the hairs out, so after drying, I took a lint brush to every article of clothing, to try and get what pet hair was left. It was a complete nightmare! And so from that, I went on Amazon, read a million and 1 reviews and bought the Wonder Washer.  WHAT a JOKE! Then I made a second purchase for the E-clean‚Ä¶ NOT fun either. SO, after more research and more re-reading of all those millions of reviews on every single portable washer unit on Amazon, I made the brave decision, took a leap of faith, and got The Laundry Alternative Super Compact 5.5 lb capacity. Ill be honest, I was really trying to save money with the other 2 previous purchases, but what I got was a huge headache, ruined clothes, broken machines, time lost, lint monsters, and sprained wrist from wringing clothes (not really, but you get my drift). In the long run, many months from now, maybe even years, that this Laundry Alternative Super Compact will eventually pay for itself.  So my review, to be fair was going to be a 1 star, maybe 2 stars. The machine I received came poorly packaged and the unit had a crack on the inside motor area. It still leaks from the body, but that‚Äôs due to it being cracked and from it being poorly made/ assembled. Here‚Äôs is a brief rundown of my first impressions: -Received item in a non-secured box. The bottom of the box was taped on, and was not part of the box. -When opened, broken pieces of foam came out of the box and were all broken inside the washer where the motor and wires are. I carefully vacuumed the inside to gather as much of the broken pieces of foam. -I thoroughly inspected the unit, and found 1 major crack on the motor cover, and the front of the unit being unevenly put together. -The exterior outside unit was dirty, with dirt marks around it. -When lifted and carried to kitchen to hook it up, there were swishing sounds of water. -Major water leaks from base and side exterior. No water leaks from hose/ faucet hookup. -A random black plastic block fell from the inside. I have no idea what‚Äôs it for. It had grease on it.  AND here is my simple comparison bullets: Laundry Mat: Pros: -Get multiple loads of wash done  Cons: -Dollars and Quarters‚Ä¶. -Other people‚Äôs clothes you don‚Äôt know being washed in that very same washer you just washed your clothes in. Do you really think your clothes are being cleaned? -Time consuming -Cant really leave to tend to other errands, or do other things. You spend roughly 2+ hours at the laundry mat, not including fold time.  The Laundry Alternative: Pros: -Don‚Äôt have to go to laundry mat -NO more scrounging for quarters! -You can stay home and search Amazon for more cool apartment gadgets to buy to make your life easier. -Pretty quiet. -Once you get the hang of it, no babysitting! It‚Äôs all automatic and really does get your clothes clean -Pretty Compact and doesn‚Äôt take a lot of room. I have a very narrow small kitchen, so for me, IM going to need to store it someplace else. -It‚Äôs a wash, rinse, spin cycle! -NO SMELL! The WW and e-clean had this toxic smell to it, this didn‚Äôt. That was my fear, as I‚Äôm highly sensitive to chemical smells and IM very happy to report, no toxic smell (at least mine didn‚Äôt). -Fast Delivery, was delivered by USPS on a Sunday! Ordered on a Friday :)  Cons: -Very Flimsy gooseneck holder. Kept coming off the draining hose and wouldn‚Äôt stay put when water would drain. WATER went everywhere. I had to manually hold it in the sink every time the rinse cycle went. Eventually, after the 3rd wash, I took one side of the gooseneck holder and attached it to the black water hose (the one from faucet to laundry unit) and this kept the draining hose to stay in the sink (NO more babysitting ) -35 lbs is not too heavy, but not light enough (actually more annoying) to store and bring back to kitchen. Needs caster wheels that lock in place when using washer. -Only able to use cold water via the hose attachment. IM sure you could get a different hose that's suitable for any temperature, but that should have been done by the manufacture. -No gentle cycle -Pretty much everything is plastic made. The inside washing area is stainless steel. The agitator is plastic. -It will literally take you all day to do your laundry, as it‚Äôs very small and can only wash roughly 5.5lbs of clothes. So best used for daily, every other day light wash. (took me 5 hours to do 4 loads with clean up, hang drying, troubleshooting etc, those 4 loads would of been 1 load at the laundry mat) - The power cord is slightly too short. Needs about an extra 12 inches to it.  The initial leaking caused a major mini flood on my kitchen floors. The gooseneck hose holder is very flimsy and didn‚Äôt hold the hose properly onto the sink. When the rinse cycle started, the drain hose started doing the cobra dance and the drain water went all over everywhere. It was the first time for me to use this machine, so getting to know it was not friendly.  The washing portion of it was great. Very little to no lint left on the clothing after wash. Spin cycle does a great job, makes hang drying fasterand NO wringing of the clothes to get excess water! Even with the cracked motor and water leaking from the sides, I was able to wash 4 loads to test it out. With the first two loads, when the rinse cycle finished, dead small flies and foam particles came out. The second load, it was more just foam particles. The other two loads were to re-wash some of the towels I washed in the 1st & 2nd load, since the first load leaked and spewed water all over the floor that caused a mini flood. My kitchen rug was soaked, not only did I use towels, but went through an entire roll of paper towels. Water was everywhere. The only good thing that came out of that was my floor had an unexpected cleaning.  The good news is, that mini flood was not from the assembly of the actual unit, that flood was from the drain hose. After the 2nd wash, I was pretty familiar with how to navigate this bad boy, and by the 4th wash, I was sitting on my couch for 30 minutes while that load washed.  The unit still leaks water from the bottom (probably not safe because of the wiring and plug, and from the top/sides. IM not going to use the machine again, until I get a new one.  Overall, even with the broken machine, IM REALLY impressed with how well the machine handles clothes. IM impressed with the high quality faucet/hose attachment (I say this, because of the E-clean experience I had, you had to hold the cheaply made hose onto the sink while water filled the wash). No leaks from my sink faucet, no leaks to the washing unit (ALTHOUGH, when detaching water hose from washing unit, it will leak, so make sure you have a towel handy). I also love that the front right leg is an actual rotating wheel, which adjust to level with floor. It keeps the unit from shaking in spin cycle. -Once you understand and troubleshoot the trial and errors of the machine, you will not need to sit and babysit. The first 3 loads I did, water went everywhere, and I literally had a flood!  I do believe I need a new unit, one that issecurely packed carefully  and assembled properly so it doesn‚Äôt leak. I'll probably update this review once i get a new machine. My apologies, as this review has turned into a story. Right no",8/31/15,

I suspect this is because not all the soap is rinsed off.

This is my first experience with an Electrolux product and I was looking forward to owning one. I purchased the 4.3 Cu. Ft. Front Load Washer with IQ-Touch‚Ñ¢ Controls featuring Perfect Steam in March and had it installed on the 23rd (2015). It is now April 25 and I hate this washing machine. I wish I had chosen a different brand. The technician has already been out once because I had a slow water leak coming down the front of the washer. The tech discovered there was a defect in the door, which created a gap large enough for water to pool inside the door. A new door is on order but it took two weeks for it to come in. I was approximately one week away from the new door arriving and the washer started having other issues. The washer developed a knocking sound when it went into the spin cycle and rocked more than it did when first installed. The spin cycle is so loud it is not conducive to a hold a normal conversation if near the washer or trying to watch television in the next room. In fact, the shaking and noise levels are so much louder and disruptive on this Electrolux then what I experienced with the 10-year-old washer I replaced. Even when on its &#34;last leg&#34;, my old washer never sounded or behaved as my new one does. This is horrible; I cannot believe I paid for a product that is already having numerous problems within the first month.<br /><br />Update:  Horrible Product -1st Review No longer on Electrolux Website<br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Interestingly, my first review (above) of this washer was removed from the Electrolux website; it was in no way inappropriate and 100% true. I am on my 2nd new washer in 6 months and the new one is now broken down with the same problem as the first one. I was told the pulley system slipped, causing a hole in the wash tub, which means I am once again without a washer for weeks at a time while waiting for repairs.",8/29/15,NEGATIVE

I have not had any difficult with ...,"This range exceeds all expectations for its appearance, value and seemingly sturdy build.  I have not had any difficult with the manner in which the burners ignite as other reviewers have.  You do have to hold in the knob for about 3 seconds to ensure the flame does not go out but I don't find this annoying.  The burners themselves are powerful and easy to adjust once you get accustomed to the function of the inner and outer rings of fire.  The oven does put out copious amounts of heat into the kitchen through the vent at the top of the oven door and it heats up the control knobs quite a bit.  I guess that is what you get when graduating to this high powered performer.  The oven heats up very quickly and the broiler works great.  I took delivery of the range during a southern California heat wave and the first time I fired up the oven it super heated my kitchen.  This range would be more appreciated during a cold night in Minesotta but probably not where I live where it rarely gets below 40 degrees.  The most troubling aspect to this range and the reason I did not give it 5 stars is the lack of adjustability of the height.  If you compare it to almost every other range in existence you will find that its maximum height adjusted with the feet is below what most installations will require.  So my installer had to custom fit some lumber under the legs of my new 3K range to get it to the proper height. Unacceptable.  I guess the designers were in a coma when they configured the dimensions.  Also, they stupidly fit a HUGE power cable that sticks straight out from the wall plug at least 3 inches making it impossible to slide the range anywhere near to the back wall.  So again, my professional and very astute installer had to run an extension cord. He cautioned me to remove it if I ever need service because F&P would void the warranty. By the way, the flush designed power cord pictured in the F&P manual that would have worked perfectly is no where near the style that is supplied with the range.  Again, a real disappointment from a design perspective.  I got the range for $2999.00 and a promotion included a $600.00 over the range microwave for free.  So this was a real value if you compare it to other brands where the entry point for just the range is probably $3500.00.  I also got the F&P refrigerator and DishDrawer which both work great.  This is a very stylish suite of appliances.",8/29/15,POSITIVE

Capacity Steam Washer/Dryer Combination with TurboWash, TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System, NeveRust Stainless Steel Drum, Allergiene Cycle in White",Major Appliances,1,25,30,N,Y,Drying did not work.,"I really wanted this combo unit to work. The unit has great options for washing clothes and is quite. However, the dryer feature did not work or was malfunctioning on the unit i received. What I noticed about the drying feature on my unit is that I could hear it spraying bursts of water into the machine when it was on the dry cycle. So the result was hot wet clothes when the machine cycle ended. How wet you ask? They were soaked, I could wring out the water and get them more dry by hand then this machine could do on an 3 hour dry cycle. Like others who purchased this machine I knew that the clothes would have a damp feeling after washing/drying. That is not the case with this machine, my clothes are soaked. Perhaps your still thinking I did not &#34;really&#34; know how to use this machine. For a test I put in completely dry clothes into this machine, turned on just the dryer and can you guess what happened? Thats right! The clothes came out wet! Weird... Anyways, I did some other tests and I found out if I removed the drain hose to a bucket on the floor the clothes would come out almost dry but I had to keep an eye on the bucket because it would fill up twice before the dry cycle ended. The reason why I moved the drain hose to a bucket is because the water did not create a hydro-lock and I let gravity drain the water out. LG did however do their best to help me. They do not have a rep that repairs in my area so I have to return this one and they will cut me a check. But like I said earlier I really wanted this machine to work and now I have to go through the motions of replacing it. Unfortunately, I do not have the confidence that I will replace this unit with the same one. I will look elsewhere.<br />If you're on the ropes about buying one yourself then consider yourself warned. I'd say you have a 50/50 chance you'll get a unit that will give you damp clothes over soaked clothes. Either way you're getting one or the other. And I was one of the people who said to myself &#34;I can live with damp clothes if they dry when I hang them up.&#34; Yeah right, good luck to you!yself &#34;I can live with damp clothes if they dry when I hang them up.&#34; Yeah right, good luck to you!",8/28/15,NEGATIVE

Here are some things we discovered about the Miele after it was installed.<br /><br />1) It can take anywhere from a minimum of 3 to 7 punches of the touch control buttons to get the burner on and to the level you wish. You have press to turn the whole unit on, press to turn the specific burner on, and press for the specific setting either once more (for very high or very low) or multiple times if you want a medium setting like 5.<br /><br />2) The controls are not at all intuitive.  No guest at our home (we tested about a dozen) was successful in operating the stove without a tutorial.  The markings on the touch pad do not give you a clue about what should be pressed and in what order.  You cannot disable the lock on the whole unit, and few people realized that the stove unit needed to be unlocked before you go to a specific burner.<br /><br />3) The controls are not very sensitive.  Some people's fingers produced very inconsistent responses for some of the touch screen buttons. Almost everyone made the mistake, when first trying, of not holding their finger on the pad long enough for it to respond.  It takes a lot longer than most touch pads on most other devices.  But for some fingers it took multiple presses on a button to get a response and in some cases would not respond at all.  There was a lack of touch responsivity  about 30% of the time.  The technical support staff, when called, recommended changing the room lighting  (it's light sensitive) and &#34;using the middle finger&#34; instead of the index finger, but these did not really help.  There is actually a youtube video showing some of these problems with another model: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KItZaAM8Jtk.<br /><br />4) The unit and all the burners arbitrarily shut off quite frequently. A misplaced touch can do it, as can the presence of some object on the top of the range.  Then you need to go through the multiple punch routine to get it going again.<br /><br />5) The top itself, while shiny and cool looking, is also so slick that pots and pans can easily slide around, sometimes sloshing out their contents.<br /><br />The good news is that Miele did agree to take the unit back and give us a refund. Still I urge the industry to rethink the controls on these units and make more working units available to customers to try out in showrooms to see if it really suits them.bject on the top of the range.  Then you need to go through the multiple punch routine to get it going again.<br /><br />5) The top itself, while shiny and cool looking, is also so slick that pots and pans can easily slide around, sometimes sloshing out their contents.<br /><br />The good news is that Miele did agree to take the unit back and give us a refund.

I started doing my own research on Ionized Alkaline Water machines and really liked the price and quality of the Life Ionizer and started communicating with the company about their machine. The customer service was outstanding and has been for the past three years since buying my machine. I share the water with friends and neighbors and they all really like the taste of clean fresh tasting water. The city water here in Huntsville Alabama has a lot of chlorine in the water. now as soon as I put a glass of tap water up to my nose to drink it when I am away from home I can hardly stand it. We cook with the water, make coffee and tea with it and believe me you can really tell the difference. I personally recommend the Life Ionizer machine and hope you will take a serious look the the companies line of products if you are thinking about a water machine.

When it spins, it almost completely dries most of my laundry. The only negative I have is that I needed the water hammer eliminators. They were 9.99 at lowes (1 for cold & hot). It would have been nice if they were included because from what I've read from reviews, it's a frequent issue with this machine. I can look way past that though. My 3-yr old had an upset stomach when he woke up.  He threw up on his sheets. We rinsed them off, but there was a red stain on them that I assumed would be there forever.

My family and I use a lot of ice daily, especially me. The cost of purchasing ice at the store added up quickly - we went through two or more bags of ice each week at a cost of $2 for a 10 lb bag of ice. Easily we were spending at least $20 per month on ice. We purchased ours at Sam's Club for $99, so after about 5-6 months we have more than recovered what we would have spent on purchasing bags of ice.<br /><br />For those who have complained that their units do not work, there is usually a 30-day period to ask for a replacement or refund. Looking at the overall positive reviews, it would seem that malfunctioning units are the exception rather than the rule. The item that we purchased has worked flawlessly since we purchased it, more than a year ago.<br /><br />I don't know if everyone puts it to use in the same way. We use it to keep a full supply of ice in our freezer at all times. If we run low, we just fill the ice maker with water and let it do its thing. It only drops a handful of ice at a time, so if you were waiting for enough ice to fill your cup, you might get frustrated waiting. So we turn it on when our ice supply drops, and pass by occasionally to dump the ice into the freezer ice container. The ice maker will stop making ice and an indicator light will go on if the tray gets too full, or if the machine runs out of water.<br /><br />I saw the reviews of other ice addicts who were very happy with this ice maker.

I am a single guy and I have a mix of office clothing and casual and the usual mix of sheet, towels, etc.  I was becoming unhappy with air drying because many items were a little stiff and scratchy with air drying (mainly towels and jeans).  I just got the dryer last night and I have dried two loads.  Here are my initial impressions.<br /><br />It is slightly larger than my Panda washer which does 6-7 lbs of clothes.  It is heavier and is constructed of steel like a real washer, but of a thinner gauge of metal.  Seems very well constructed, given the price and that it is essentially &#34;portable&#34; or small-sized.  Seems like it will last.  Well packed in a large box with padding.  No damage in shipping.  No strange chemical or plastic smell at all out of the box, unlike the Panda washer.<br /><br />I had no 'loose belt' issue (read some other reviews) -- the dryer worked immediately.  The noise level:  louder than the Panda Washer (which is very quiet) but quieter than a hair dryer by a fair margin.  In fact the sound does sound sort of like a cross between a regular full sized dryer and a hair dryer. I was able to watch television in the next room (no closed door) without a problem, and I'd say this is no louder than machines in a laundry room.<br /><br />I load my Panda 6-7 lb washer close to capacity every load. As a single guy, I do laundry once per week with my Panda washer (highly recommended).  By the time the second load was washed, the first load in the dryer was dry enough for me to take it out of the dryer.  The first load was dried with the 'low heat' setting.  The second load, towels and such, I left running and went to bed.  The timer was set to about 30 or 40 min with the &#34;high heat&#34; button pressed in.  This morning, my towels were soft, and bone-dry.  So were the things I washed in the first load -- and everything was SOFT and FRESH (I used 'linen' scented liquid fabric softener from Target) -- unless air drying, which leaves everything wrinkled.<br /><br />With darks or not very soiled colors, using the Panda, it takes me 3 minutes to fill machine; 8 minutes wash time; 3 minutes to drain and fill for rinse; 5 minutes for rinse agitation; 5 minutes to drain and spin.  That is  about 24 minutes per load.  At high heat, with a not-over-filled dryer load, your first load will be close to dry by the time your second load is ready.  This will depend on fabrics and your heat setting.<br /><br />I specifically got this model, which is slightly larger than the smaller 5 lb load capacity dryer which is also available with slight variances from various vendors, because I usually do between 2-4 loads when I wash, and I want the extra size to dry up to 2 loads of wash in the dryer simultaneously. So far, I am very pleased, because it seems that this thought process is accurate.  I expect that my stuff dried quickly because the dryer was slightly loaded.<br /><br />A commercial or full sized dryer would do the job in about half the time, but those other machines are capable of much higher temps.  This little guy cannot match the big boys, but if the goal is to be productive in your home while taking care of laundry, this is a great route to take.<br /><br />Between the washer and this dryer, I have now spent $500 or so on the 'at home' laundry experiment.  I fretted over whether I really &#34;needed&#34; a dryer and whether around $300 for the dryer was too much money.  My worries are gone.  This machine does a beautiful job of drying towels, clothes, and does it  a bit quicker than the time estimates I found in other reviews.  The container will easier fit my King bed sheets or 2 Panda washer loads, yet the dryer is still small enough to be only slightly larger than the Panda and I can move it easily (though I am a pretty big and strong fella, so your mileage may vary).  Great device.<br /><br />I have purchased a steam iron and a ironing pad and have decided to learn to iron and avoid dry cleaners as much as possible, since my experience is that white shirts end up missing button, stained, or wear out too quickly at a commerical laundry.  I never thought I'd become a laundry hobbyist...lol...<br /><br />Only con is that I wish that it were cheaper and perhaps on wheels to make it easier to move.",8/28/15,POSITIVE

We choose the gas over electric this time, and I am so happy we did, gas dries so much better than electric and your bill will be so much less to.<br /><br />The front loader washer is pretty sweet for sure. Everything is digital, just set to your settings, and will always remember what you picked, tells you how long it will take. Sings a song when it turns on, when its done, and sings a whole song to. Buttons are huge, and you only need to put your finger on the button and will set it. The only thing I wish was the digital board had a back-light for night-time using. The door is huge, opens and closes easy. The area for detergent is easy to reach and the bucket can sit on top and drip in easy. The door does lock shut, but there is a button for emergency release in case you have pranksters in your home. We also requested the bottom stowaway for each of them, they are huge and holds detergent, softener, and more easily.<br /><br />The front loader dryer is better with gas, and will save you money. I love how the door opens the same side as the dryer so you can pull items from the washer to right into the dryer. The drums of the two are the same size. They have bedding, delicate, wrinkle free, static free settings on the dryer. The dryer also is digital, with easy tapping buttons, tells you how long the dryer will take, and has a song for turning on, off, and when done. The settings per the two, with about the same settings, with the dryer taking only ten minutes longer, and these are both the simple settings. The dryer lint trap isn‚Äôt the best, super hard to take the lint out, as there is no place the release the actual plastic when you take it out, to remove it, so little fingers are the best to use for that.<br /><br />All in all we love these Samsung washer and dryer sets, you can find them retail for $999.99 and you can get rebates back up to $200 if you were to buy them at Home Depot or Lowe‚Äôs as seen on a commercial.  These are a huge step up to what we head top and front loaders from 2006, reaching almost ten years old, so these babies are AWESOME.

Overall, it does the job it was intended to do. I keep both red and white wines in it, by keeping the temperature at 56F. That's borderline low for red, and borderline high for white, so it's not perfect. But, I was prepared for that because it is a single-zone cooler after all.<br /><br />My wife and I don't drink that much wine (2 bottles a week, more if we have guests over). I had planned to purchase a second unit, so that we'd have one for red wines, and a separate one for white wines. But, we're happy with the borderline temperature setting so far.<br /><br />The spacing of the metal racks is barely sufficient for regular-size bottles. We have problems with any wine bottles that are wider or taller than usual, even if they are 750 ml. We end up having to use the space with no racks in order to stack wide bottles directly on top of each other.

Apartments cost a ton to rent, and space comes at a premium (in fact, apartments that have built-in dishwashers are often $100-$200 more per month, which adds up fast). Unfortunately, I'm also extremely lazy in that I hate doing dishes every day, or ever for that matter. It was getting to the point where literal mountains of dishes were cluttering my already space limited counters. I woke up one day, and decided this needed to change. I asked myself, &#34;What's the cheapest way to solve the problem of unending dirty dishes?&#34;. So I logged on my favorite dating app and got myself a nice girlfriend.<br /><br />I thought all my problems were solved. I was wrong. Very wrong.<br /><br />It turns out that getting a girlfriend actually INCREASED the amount of dirty dishes. I was shocked. Saddened. Deeply disturbed. Every night, I curled up in to a ball among my dishes and cried myself to sleep, hoping my tears would wash away the dried up Indian curry from a month ago, or loosen the cheese cement attached to my mac n' cheese bowl. Alas, it did nothing. About to give up, I turned to my previous dishwasher-turned-girlfriend and begged for help. After refusing any sort of manual labor plea, we eventually turned to our online friends and discovered the SPT countertop dishwasher. It was a match made in heaven. The SPT easily gobbled up all my dish-related problems and spit out gorgeous, piping-hot, sparkling clean dishes. All I have to do is throw a little dishwasher detergent packet it, click the hose on to the sink, and fire that puppy up. The little SPT box is so whisper quiet, you can practically hear the dishes sigh in relief as they deep soak all the previous months of abuse and neglect away.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.

After requesting a return on Amazon, I was contacted by the company about possibly just checking to make sure the cables were all plugged in for the touch panel.  While the instructions that they sent were clearly for a different model hood (so I disassembled more than I had to trying to follow the directions) I was able to re-seat a few cables and tighten the screws behind the touch panel to get it working again.  Customer service was very helpful and friendly. We found that the LEDs (while very bright) were also VERY yellow-toned.  We replaced them with similar, but not so yellow bulbs that matched a little better with our under cabinet lighting.  Installation was pretty simple as well.  We had to run a vent outside (we had no vent there), so that took quite a bit of time, but once we had it in place, the hood went up very quickly, but did require two sets of hands. The buttons work very well, and are very responsive to touch, and the hood does a pretty good job blowing steam and smells outside. I know some have complained about the noise, but I have to say-- most of the noise comes from the duct work.  Running it straight out of the box with nothing hooked up, it seemed VERY quiet.

I used  #10  1 1/2&#34; stainless screws with washers on 2 of the screws.  ( no room on the other 2 screws for washers).  The unit is quite solid and level.  The electrical wires are a bit short, but workable. Tech support advises hardwiring the unit, because of the fact that using a plug could max out the 15 amp service of kitchen GFCI's.  ( Again, more irony, because the power for the hardwiring comes from a 15 amp service from the kitchen GFCI's )  None the less, i opted for the plug in, with no problems.  The unit is fairly quiet.  Again this is subjective, because acoustics are different in each kitchen.  The unit, however does evacuate smoke for most cooking, but VERYPOORLY for the self cleaning feature of the range.  There is a mild increase in draw, as well as an increase in sound,  without the stainless grilles.  The grilles do catch grease, but they are flimsy and easily twist upon removal and insertion.  The  LED lights do a good job illuminating the stove.  We have a black stove with black 20x20 tiles on the black splash, and the added light is helpful.  Opening a window a few inches will help with the necessary make up air needed to ensure maximum air flow.  The controls are hard to see/use, and are not back lit.  To use them, I have  to duck down and look up under the lip of the vent hood. I imagine with time we'll memorize the button functions.  In summary, the unit works, but there are several things which took away from the perceived value of this unit.  Update:  After having this product for a couple of years, It is obvious that the draw is not near the rated CFM.  I personally installed the ducting and calculated the measurements per industry code.  Smoke will plume around the unit when cooking.  Frequently at greasy film is on top of the unit, telling me that it does not work as it should.",8/26/15,MIXED

READ YOUR WARRANTY!!!!!,"We bought this refrigerator in March of 2014 and there really were very few reviews about it at that time. I was very dismayed to see that Amazon's reviews of this product (with 33 reviewers at the time) granted a wapping 1-star. ONE! Even that is too much. You can't even fit two gallons of milk into either of the containers on the door! Nonetheless, it is an expensive refrigerator from Kitchenaid, so what could go wrong!?!?! Our ice make stopped working a few days ago and now our freezer isn't working. My wife called Kitchenaid twice today and they said that there was nothing they could do, but that she could be an extended warranty for a year for $339 and then they would fix it or that we could go on our own and fix it with another company. TWICE!!! I called and they finally came to grips. I found another user review on Google via Home Depot for this item that really helped me. The parts that fail are actually warrantied for years 2-5. CHECK YOUR WARRANTY .... they will not offer you this info. Here is a copy of it: http://www.kitchenaid.com/digitalassets/KFIS29PBMS/Warranty_EN.pdf. If that is too much work, I have pasted the important stuff below. Here is what you need to know and see though:<br /><br />SECOND THROUGH FIFTH YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY ON CAVITY LINER<br />AND SEALED REFRIGERATION SYSTEM<br />In the second through fifth years from the date of purchase, when this major<br />appliance is installed, operated and maintained according to the instructions<br />attached to or furnished with the product, KitchenAid brand will pay for factory<br />specified replacement parts and repair labor for the following components to correct<br />non-cosmetic defects in materials and workmanship in this part that prevent function<br />of the refrigerator and that existed when this<br /> major appliance was purchased:<br />‚ñ† Refrigerator/freezer cavity liner if the part cracks due to defective materials or<br />workmanship.<br />‚ñ† Sealed Refrigeration system (includes compressor, evaporator, condenser, dryer<br />and connecting tubing).<br /><br />UNBELIEVABLE!<br /><br />  It kills me to know, however, that I bought a lemon and will have to live with it and replace these parts again every 10-15 months until my 5 year warranty runs out. Believe me, I will not hesitate to use it over and over again until the 5 years are up or they get me another refrigerator that works. Poor quality and cost-cutting on their part is not going to help their bottom line this time! I hope this helps some of you as well. If you still encounter issues, please forward your problem to the office of your state's Attorney General. They eat this stuff up! :)",8/26/15,NEGATIVE

Mine arrived a few days ago in a timely manner. (I bundled it with other items and got free shipping - I'm not a Prime member). Installed very easily.  Unlike other reviewers, it took my filter over 15 gallons of water flushed through before the grayish carbon color dissipated. I still notice a slight gray tinge when I pour a pitcherful into a white sink. That 15 gallons cost me money and, although I watered my trees with most of it, I didn't appreciate &#34;wasting&#34; that money. I'll still be buying ice for a while because the ice cube mechanisms still have residual carbon bits that haven't flushed out. All-in-all, I'm sure I saved a little, but will try Whirlpool's own brand next time.  ****UPDATE ***** The folks (Jennifer) at Waterfall Filter Co. read my review and contacted me. She assured me that this was an unusually large amount of water to have to flush through the filter - should only be about 1 gallon - and suggested I may have received a faulty one. They sent me a replacement filter right away, at no charge!! The new filter did, in fact, only require 2 pitcherfuls, about 1 gallon, to flush the water through clearly. Good customer service.

Item came with a chip in the corner but I barely notice it and it doesn't affect the cycle.

Didn't buy it for laziness, just didn't have time to do dishes, so this was a life saver. Fits great on my counter, easy to install, easy to remove the hose attachment when you need the sink (when it's not running of course.

My son used it to make popcorn. We haven't had micro popcorn in a really long time. The front panel is a bit small so I think people with not great eyesight may want to consider that. If you look at it straight on and in good lighting, it isn't so bad but if it is at an angle with low lighting, the panel labels are a bit hard to discern.

White Top Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,0,0,N,N,"washer smells horribly, must be cleaned-are you kidding","Called 8/24/15- spoke with representative about our two year old washer.Nothing Whirlpool can or will do.They have no other complaints about rust inside the lid and inside rim at bleach dispenser nor chipping of paint from lid. When asking the Whirlpool representative about the rust, he assured us there were no other complaints.This is hard to believe since our recent research clearly shows that other brands have had to replace tops due to rust. As for clothes not cleaning, no response to this issue. Whirlpool has not trained salespersons and therefore at the mercy of Lowes hard sales tactics and we were very delinquent in researching numerous complaints before purchasing Whirlpool Cabrio Platinum Model WTW8240YWD.Ranked lowest possible from Consumer Affairs with hundreds of complaints.Whirlpool should be ashamed of product, clothes do not come clean, there is no soak cycle, no way to open mid cycle without loosing all water, washer smells horribly, must be cleaned-are you kidding? Who cleans the washer that is supposed to clean clothes with a special cleaner?? We understand safety issues of water in open machine, wonder if Whirlpool understands the need to have a 'soak' feature to clean clothes.  Undereducated buyers like us and the totally undereducated salesperson at Lowes were obviously a horrible combination.It was all about sales for them. No one mentioned and we had no clue that the huge drum would not clean clothes even using less water than a traditional machine. We thought 'platinum' meant a high quality machine.  It clearly was a cleverly used buzz word for sales not a premier cleaning machine.Never, never, never purchasing Whirpool anything again. Wonder if Whirlpool cares, if they read the Consumer Affairs reports, if they respond. Our hard earned money is wasted. Our clothes are dirty, the washer smells, and the top is rusting out!",8/24/15,NEGATIVE

Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,4,0,0,N,Y,Love to nuke,"Good price, has continued to work very well since December 2014 (8 months). My only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center. It therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns. I don't see what could cause the loose fit. Nevertheless, the carousel does turn, just not very quietly.<br /><br />Otherwise, great buy. It is still easy to clean. I love using the 1, 2 and 3 settings for one-touch cooking times of 1, 2 or 3 minutes. I really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching &#34;Start&#34; one time. Some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large &#34;open&#34; button is pushed, the entire microwave moves, but I have not had that experience. I seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables, popcorn, potato, etc. I had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn - the microwave didn't sense a need to stop cooking. However, it's fine for baking a potato.<br /><br />I do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior, which contributes to the 1.4 cu ft interior volume.

I've tried contacting the seller, but have yet to get a response. I use this in conjunction with a breathing mobile washer and it's a great system for apartment living! **Update** I have since heard from the seller and they have more than made the situation right so I am now therefore pleased to give this 5 stars. Their product AND customer service has exceeded expectations. Today I was able to dry a full sized sheet with no trouble at all and it was sopping wet!",8/24/15,POSITIVE

What that does is trap food particles that end up washing back on the dishes. A terrible design in my opinion. What we have to do to get a relatively clean washing is to first remove every piece of food from our dishes in the sink. If we don't the food ends up dried on the dishes after the washing and drying cycles are done. Oh, and yes, we clean the filter weekly.",8/24/15,NEGATIVE

And has a somewhat quirky characteristic of forming frost on the inside rear wall of the refrigerator section, when the compressor is on, this then melts and is channeled away down a small hole when the compressor is off. Called a Cycle Defrost. The freezer section will require a manual defrost too. All in all the Avanti is good package for the $349 i paid for it at time of purchase.

Subsequently we bought my parents a similar model and they've *never* had a UE problem.

It held the temperature well IF the cooler was completely full. Over time it started to stray a few degrees from the set temperature, especially the upper portion, progressively getting worse. The unit also started getting noisier which should have been a tell-tale sign it was about to quit on us.<br /><br />Right about at the 1-year of ownership mark we came home and saw the external temperature reading for the top section indicating 93 degrees! I immediately opened it up and it was blowing hot air all over our wine bottles. I would've expected the thing to just plain give up, but really didn't expect it to turn in to a heater!<br /><br />I am not sure if this is a function of thermo-electric coolers in general, but every single one of them seems to last about a year and quit on you. I was hoping with the relatively high reviews on this one that it would be different, but you get what you pay for. Stay away from this one unless you want to buy a new fridge every few months.<br /><br />To HOMEIMAGE, wouldn't cost too much to have a shut-off when the unit goes a few degrees above room temperature.

I found that it all has to do with the water evacuation hose position. The hose MUST point downward and never turn upwards. The drying system requires all water to be pumped out so it can dry properly. If not, the water remains in the system and it can not dry the clothes. I could not reuse the pipe that my previous washer used as it was too high and forced the hose to point up. I had to run the hose down to a drain in the floor. Once I did this, all items, including heavy towels and jeans came out totally dry once done. I have a feeling lol those reviews claiming wet clothes are not draining water correctly and thus giving their review an unfair low rating.

Capacity in Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,4,4,5,N,N,Really nice fridge!,"We recently replaced our Samsung, which in the 4 years since we bought it, had broken for the third time. We chose this LG which we have been happy with and there are a few features which make it really unique. We are a soccer family; coach, ref and both of our girls play, so we go through a LOT of ice. This fridge has two ice makers AND the ice cubes are smaller so when you are holding a sports water bottle up to the ice shute, the ice falls right in where old sized ice used to get stuck in the opening. It makes ice fast and the water is nice and cold which really helps. The rest of the features on the fridge are great too. The door-in-door works as expected although you have to make sure it is shut or else it will pop open. In addition, I would swear that our veggies and fruits are staying fresher longer. The space is organized well too. If I had one complaint it would be the location of the water spout. If you look closely at the picture, you would assume it comes out at the same location as the ice like most fridges but it doesn't; it comes out in the space above it which means it is above the eye level of smaller kids (say age 9 on down) and also is confusing to guests. Everyone who comes in the house uses their hand to push the water button with the cup in the ice area and it shoots water out down the front of them. It's kinda funny in a way but then there's the clean up to consider and people feel badly for making a mess which of course is silly but it is what it is. I have taken to giving people a run down of the fridge when they come for the first time and that works but is a bit of an inconvenience, especially if I forget. I don't know yet about the longevity of the fridge but if it is anything like the trouble free 10 years we have gotten out of our LG washer/dryer then I think we will be happy. The water also tastes really nice too. Very clean, like Ozarka.",8/23/15,POSITIVE

The freezer still works but we had to toss out everything from the fridge compartment due to a non-op fan & 50+ degree temps. I'm told that LG ships parts ground so if they're in stock it's usually a 3-5 day wait. If the part is on back order I'm expecting an additional 2-3 week wait.<br /><br />My wife and I really liked this model, particularly being the largest capacity counter depth we could find.

I can tell you, that yes, it does dry clothes. I bought this for drying my daughters cloth diapers and for trying it out in regards to Tiny House's and Tiny House living. If you want this for a small area, I don't recommend it unless you have a really good air filtration system. Why? Because it makes the room it's in very humid and for a Tiny House, humidity can be your worst enemy. That being said it would probably be fine if you put it in the bathroom and turned a good bathroom fan on.<br /> I put 5 or 6 prefold diapers that were hand rung, so still pretty soaked, into the tent and it took 4 hours to mostly dry them. So it works. It's like a quick version of hanging over night. They aren't fluffy like when they are in a tumble dryer. Minerals in the water set and made my diapers a bit stiff, but if you have a spin dryer or a spin cycle with your washer this type of mineral setting isn't such a problem. I imagine drying would be quicker and maybe even less humid. But if you are using a portable hand washer, you'll have to keep what I've said in mind while using this product.<br /><br />The reason I said it's sketchy is because when you turn the timer on, it sparks. Like a pilot light in a propane stove. SPARK* it makes me nervous. Also it looks like some college kid jerry rigged a hair dryer into a kids play tent and was like, this will work! and it does. but still seems like it could be a hazard if you aren't careful with it.<br /><br />I did like that you could fold up the tent into a small bag. It came with 2 clipped hangers with multiple clips on each wrack. I didn't like that the metal hang lines down't fold up into the bag or box without unscrewing them.<br /><br />If you are unsure about buying this product, I'll be posting a more complete review on my blog, www.tinyakadventure.com",8/23/15,POSITIVE

As I didn't want lint clogging the fan, or cluttering up my front yard, I purchased this lint trap. I had seen it used on the TV show Holmes Inspection (available on Netflix) and thought it a great idea. My previous system of venting into an external water trap in my 3 season porch had resulted in an horrible accumulation of lint all over the place, not to mention the fire hazard of flexible ductwork filled with lint.<br /><br />So, I'm happy to report that this does a very good job of stopping lint from progressing through my ductwork. After 5 months enough lint has reached the outside vent fill my hand (not much).<br /><br />To get it offset from the wall, and give room for the fan which I placed immediately above it, I mounted this on doubled blocks of 2x6 that I rounded off a bit and painted white before attaching with deck screws to my wall. Then I put screws right through the corners of this trap. It isn't going anywhere. I had a bit of trouble getting a decent seal to the 4 inch flexible ducting from my dryer, and it does whistle a tiny bit, but it looks OK and is functional.<br /><br />My one real issue (and I don't know if this is solvable) is that to clean the trap, I have to jerk the cover out of the box, and this action invariably brings a spray of dryer debris (little bits of hardened paper, etc.) which I have to wipe off my washer--which is immediately below this trap. As others have pointed out, the cover does not fit quite square in the box, but this might just be to allow the cover to come out at all. It doesn't appear to leak hot moist air into the room, which would be an actual problem.<br /><br />I'm quite happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone willing to listen to my epic story of installing a 30 foot dryer vent.",8/22/15,POSITIVE

We figured we were moving in a year so we didn't bother wasting more of our time. Their &#34;windows&#34; of service where ridiculous and forced us to end up taking four days off work for three visits. Why four...because one of the days they were supposed to be here between 10 and 2.......their technician called in sick which we didn't find out until 3:30 when they finally returned out call from 2:00 on the dot.<br /><br />This microwave looks great...the features seem decent enough. The problem is that the door latch broke loose inside the door which cannot be serviced...only replaced...the lowest bid from two local repair companies.....$260 bucks...this piece of garbage sells NEW on Amazon for $299.99.<br /><br />We considered buying it again because it matches the other appliances (ALL have major problems that either cant be fixed or cost nearly as much as a new unit) but here is no way I can let myself screw over the next owners as we have our house listed for sale. We are spending $125 more on a microwave that has a proven record...unfortunately it is also from the Electrolux Corporation that makes SOOOO many brands of appliances.<br /><br />I remodel kitchens for a living and I steer ALL clients away from the Frigidaire Gallery line of appliances. The problem with today's appliances isn't unique to low, middle or high end appliances. As far as service after the sale..they all suck. Don't buy &#34;newer&#34; models until folks have had time to review then after YEARS of use. I have a kitchen I did for a couple that spent nearly $25,000 on their Jenn-Air ovens, stove, refrigerator, dishwashers, and under counter ice machine. Every single one has had the repair guy out at least once...the two double ovens they bought...SEVEN visits, THREE control boards and underwhelming performance forced this couple to upgrade their entire kitchen to Viking.....not sure how much but probably in the realm of $40,000.<br /><br />My washing machine went out and I was looking at spending $1,200 until I looked at Consumer Reports...they rated mine high...but they rated a $350 top load machine higher...how could this be?

Without fail, they stock the Speed Queen.  After digging deep onto various forums regarding the machines, I was sold.  I have had my SQ unit for a week.  It runs perfect.  It cycles in under 30 minutes, spins clothes dry (unlike the #2 unit I ditched), and cleans them.  The added option of being able to add more water is a plus, but not one that I use.  Thank you Speed Queen and to the guy that sold me my third washing machine I have ever owned (only because the 2nd one was so bad).  I have faith that the unit will last me 25+ years like my previous Maytag did.",8/22/15,POSITIVE

The only things I can think of is others have either:<br /><br />A: neglected to &#34;unlock&#34; the wheels to the rolling position after arrival. (All wheels come &#34;locked&#34; you need to lift the lever on each one before installing to get them to roll).<br /><br />Or<br /><br />B: they are rolling the washer long distances, over multiple types of floors, and putting too much pressure on the machine while doing this.<br /><br />By no means are these industrial strength but, I installed on my machine (I have one of the larger capacity ones and is heavier than the standard) and have rolled back and forth from my dining room to kitchen (about 5 or 6 feet, transitioning from hardwood to kitchen tile) probably about 10-15 times so far and have had no issues whatsoever. Nothing has broke and at no time is the machine ever unsteady. I do take my time rolling with minimal pressure and make sure to lift very slightly from the transitions between rooms. Again, no issues, machine doesn't rock or move at all during washing, and at no time has anything seemed on the verge of breaking.<br /><br />If neither A or B applies to those who have broken wheels, well then my opinion is you may have just gotten a bad bunch. As long as you're realistic on how much pressure and distance these wheels can take (and you have them set in &#34;unlock&#34; to roll) I foresee no issues with these.

It has both normal and gentle agitation. The drain hose lowers to empty wash, rinse, and extraction water.  Excess water is removed from laundry by lowering the drain hose and selecting either &#34;normal&#34; or &#34;gentle&#34; agitation. The agitator will wring wet laundry by twisting it clockwise and counterclockwise. Once the tub is empty of either wash or rinse water, select &#34;drain&#34; for 5-6 minutes by the timer.  This is an excellent semi-automatic washer. Instead of spinning a basket, the Useful washer employs its oscillating agitator to &#34;twist&#34; soaked laundry. This simulates hand wringing. Importantly, the oscillating action prevents laundry balling or roping as occurs with clockwise only rotation. Individual pieces of laundry can be removed after &#34;twist and drain&#34;.  This is one of the better class of washers. The oscillating agitator not only washes and rinses, but wrings as well.  To conclude, if the oscillating control switch were labeled &#34;wash and wring&#34;, this would probably help. The real problem is that the instructions for this machine state, &#34; (4...drain the water by laying down the drain hose. Twist the laundry...) As with the control switch, there is a very subtle lack of information about the agitator spin wringing. However, there are 3 identical characters on the impeller or agitator that resemble the Easy Washing Machine Co. trademark. Easy marketed the vacuum washing machine. The vacuum bells washed, rinsed, and extracted laundry in the tub of water.  The more complicated washers employ some type of rotary spinning device to extract more water than the agitator wringing method widely possible. However, the superior &#34;twisting&#34; water extraction of the Useful washer prepares damp laundry for either line or machine drying.  I highly recommend JMilesCO.com for professionally qualified sale of the Useful washer. 5 stars across the board --way to go!ross the board --way to go!",8/22/15,POSITIVE

For instance, this gets 5 stars as a portable washer when no hook up is available not as a replacement for a top of the line hook up washer.  I have been using my Panda Washing Machine with Spin Dryer for 2 months now. It has been wonderful for me living in an apartment with no washer/dryer hook up. When it first arrived I was worried b/c the delivery service had left it upside down in the rain outside of my covered front porch. As soon as I saw it, I brought it in and dried it off as much as possible. I immediately contacted Panda, and they handled my concerns with professionalism and care. It turned out that my drying efforts were sufficient and the machine is operating without hiccups 2 months later, but I still appreciate the customer service I received in the face of my concerns.  Here are some things I have done to get the most out of my washer: 1) I'm using 2 additional filters, 1 floating one that I've tied to the side and one that I've attached to the end of the drain hose. 2) I put it on a coffee table so that when it drains I don't get water stuck in the hose. 3) I use my extendable shower head to fill the washer rather than the hose provided because you have to hold the hose provided the entire time it's filling if you're using hot water. 4) Do not use garment bags. This machine is rough and will tear your delicates and garment bags. I've been using cheese cloth bags with the strings tucked inside and those have been holding up much better. Hope you guys enjoy yours too!",8/21/15,POSITIVE

It is completely normal for the unit to run all the time to keep the wine bottles cool. The unit runs on fans, so in order to maintain temperature the fans need to be running. Please let me know if have any other questions or concerns.&#34;  We contacted them again to clarify they meant it should run 24/7 and the reply was &#34;Yes, the fans will be running constantly.&#34;  Personally we don't think it's appropriate for a cooler to run constantly especially when it has reached the set temperature.  Our refrigerator doesn't do that!  If you don't care that an appliance runs 24/7 then this would probably be a good buy for you.  We, however, are very disappointed in our purchase.<br /><br />One other note - the user manual that comes with the cooler states clearances of 1&#34; all around.  The NewAir website states 5&#34; clearances are needed.  The user manual included states ambient temperatures of around 75-80.  The user manual you can download from the website states 50-80.  Someone at NewAir should review their user manuals and get them in sync.",8/21/15,NEGATIVE

It is narrow and fits thru our 19 inch wide linen closet door where we store it.<br /><br />MEASUREMENT NOTE: The machine is around 17&#34; wide but the outlet drain hose does stick out the side and extra inch and half (so you have to add about 2 inches to the over width). The good thing here is that you have the option to switch the outlet drain hose to either the left or right side of the machine. You will also have to acknowledge that the inlet hose sticks up at the back and adds an extra 3 to 4 inches to the height (see the pictures I posted up).<br /><br />We had big leakage out the back and at the inlet connector during the first wash but once a proper wrench was used to tighten connectors with  thread seal tape there was no more leakage. We are only using this for our newborn clothes and burp clothes. This is a slight and most delicate machine so if you plan on washing heavy denim jeans, winter coats and shoes or you are using it every day then dont expect a long life out of this machine.<br /><br />The added BONUS is the spin cycle takes about 80% to 90% of the water out the clothes so you dont really need to buy a Dryer if you can spare 8 hours for line dry. Again we are only washing baby clothes so if you are washing heavy fabrics expect different results.<br /><br />Over all for the price this is a great product..",8/21/15,POSITIVE

The instructions are easy enough to understand on the card it came with, but the sticker on the front of the surge protector is in another language, so I am sticking the little business card sized instructions on the wall next to where I plugged it into. I plugged in the stand alone freezer, and waited and the green light is on. It has other settings to fix if any issues come up, but I feel more secure knowing that at least my freezer is safe if we have more power outages and surges, which happens fairly often here.

Feels and looks like red cedar but there is hardly any aroma to it.<br /><br />This has a major air circulation problem, once you fill the unit up, it will start to malfunction.  This is apparently a big problem with this product. Check cigar forums, it's a known and unaddressed problem.  I unfortunately did not do my research before getting this.  Don't make the same mistake.  The lack of circulation causes the unit to fritz out and have really bad temperature fluctuations. The lowest I've measured is 52 degrees and the highest is 78 degrees (room temp). This is all while the unit is set at 65 degrees. Next the unit cannot and will not maintain humidity, there is major air leakage in and out of the unit causing humidity to mirror room humidity. Beads can't keep up with it.<br /><br />The manufacturer is aware of these issues but their response is basically for you to return it to Amazon. Good thing I figure out these issues within 30 days.

If you do the research on these coolers, a lot of them don't even state their energy usage which is a good hint that they are terribly wasteful.  The unit states that it has Dynamic Cooling which is marketing speak for a fan. The fan blows air around the unit so that temperatures are more uniform and you won't get those hot and cool spots. I've never really had a problem with nonuniform cooling in my old cooler, but hey, it can't hurt!  With the adjustable feet screwed all the way in, the unit measures almost exactly (minus 1/16 inch) 34 inches. Keep this in mind when measuring out the space.  Overall a nice looking, reasonably priced, and very energy efficient little cooler. One star off for a sorely missing handle.",8/20/15,POSITIVE

I and am now looking to upgrade but thought I would review it here. I bought from Air and Water Inc. Its a single zone and I have had no problem with it. As others have mentioned, this is not a high end cooler. It is quiet with only a little fan noise that dies down when it reaches temperature. The bottle lay out is a little tight but I have never tried to pack it full. Occasionally it will not reach the low set point, for me ~56F. When this happened the first time, I could not figure out what was going on. However, I pulled the unit out and found a square foam air filter over the fan on the back of the unit that was full of dust. I washed this filter out and put it back in. Presto, it went back to keeping temperature. This has happened twice in the three years I've had this and both times I was able to fix the problem by washing the filter. Nothing in the manual about cleaning this filter but it has worked for me. Overall, for the price I paid, it was worth it.",8/20/15,POSITIVE

My biggest complaint is how incredibly difficult it is to get this oven to maintain a constant temperature. If I want to bake something at 350 degrees I have to set it to at least 400. If I set it at 350 it never gets hotter than about 275. Then once I get it preheated to the temperature I want I have to constantly monitor it. I purchased an oven thermometer and that's the only way I can tell how hot it is. The temperature tends to vary all the time; I've had it jump from 350 to almost 500 in less than 10 minutes WITHOUT my touching the control! It will also go to the cold side..it's a real juggling act to keep a steady temperature.<br />I had a technician from our local Gas Company come to inspect the oven and calibrate it and he said he couldn't calibrate the thermometer because this oven doesn't have the part needed to do so!

Overall it's a nice looking fridge, however when it comes to performance it misses the mark. The first issue we had was the temperature setting, the lowest temperature you can set the fridge to is 38F, however the temperature readout on the front bezel indicates that the coldest it ever gets is 46F. Secondly, the door lock is really finicky, it requires a decent amount of force to properly engage it. If not properly engaged, you can expect to have semi-chilled contents inside your fridge. Lastly, and this is the biggest issue we've had, is the condensation inside the fridge. For some reason, this fridge creates and exorbitant amount of condensation inside it, so much so that we've had to line the bottom of the inner compartment with a towel, which we replace daily, in order to soak up all the condensation. When we replace this towel every morning, it is fully saturated with water (aka dripping wet).  We've contacted the manufacturer regarding this and they've been of little to no help. They asked us to ensure that the door was fully locked, and that we weren't using it in a high humidity environment, two criteria which we met. Given that the market selection for other fridges of this capacity is lacking, we have come to terms with having to swap out wet towels every morning and triple checking our door lock. Unless you really need a fridge this size, I would recommend getting something else that is either smaller or larger than the goFridge.",8/20/15,NEGATIVE

The initial charge is $306.03, with a credit of $60 when the defective board is returned to them, for a final cost of $246.03.  Add to this the service charge from the technician.  Considering that this machine had light, infrequent use and cost more than $650 new, the price of the part and the repair are unreasonable.  Although other reviews note the same part defect, Whirlpool feels no culpability.  This is not your mom or dad's Whirlpool and these models are not made to last.  I won't buy another Whirlpool (or Maytag which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool).",8/20/15,NEGATIVE

My initial refrigerator BRFB1800SSIM had an ice maker that would not release ice cubes and had water freezing in the ice bin. A repairman was sent to replace the ice maker unit. The problem was not resolved. Blomberg's service provider Eastern Marketing noted this was a known problem. A fix from the factory was pending for several months from late 2014, but by mid-2015, Eastern Marketing concluded a completely new refrigerator would have to be installed. A year after initial contact, a new BRFB1822SSL was delivered, and installed (at my expense). The ice maker again failed after 2-3 weeks. The design of the ice maker is faulty. Ice does not release from the ice tray, and water flows over the ice tray, further freezing the tray in place. Excess water flows into the ice bin and freezes. The cycle repeats and the tray becomes increasingly caked with ice, further preventing ice from dropping out of the tray.  Update 1: It is currently 2015-12-29 and I am still awaiting a response from Eastern Marketing and Blomberg. See reviews for BRFB1800SSIM.  Update: As of January 2016, the ice-maker was redesigned and installed on my replacement BRFB1822SL with a quick 30-minute service visit. The new design is improved by over-torquing the ice tray, twisting the tray gently to ensure the ice separates from the tray. The ice tray rotates twice per tray-refilling cycle, allowing &#34;two tries&#34; to twist the ice out of the tray. The amount of water dispensed into the tray is reduced, thereby making smaller ice cubes and preventing joint ice-cubes from consolidating on the tray. I am satisfied enough to improve my rating to 4 Stars, with one deducted for the previous inconvenience discussed above. I never thought I'd be so happy to hear the sound of ice falling into a tray.  Update 2: I spoke too soon... After 3-4 successful batches of ice, the problem re-occurred. This time the water misses the ice tray completely, spewing water all over the ice-bin. Beyond unbelievable. I will post a video shortly.",8/18/15,NEGATIVE

The instruction manual is confusing when explaining the grill function. By trial and error, I discovered that frozen baguettes and pizzas come out wonderful, but chicken nuggets and fish fingers -- not so much.<br />The unit has extra insulation for the grill function. For shorter cooking times, the oven works like a 1000W unit, but longer times, it heats up like a lot more powerful unit. The insulation may also contribute to the fact that microwave is very quiet in operation.<br />All in all, this is a worthy replacement to my departed Samsung.

It creates perfectly clear ice thanks to the industrial design of always having water move over the cooling elements. It makes ice fast.  It also doesn't drip water onto your counter like others that condensate on the door and when you open and close spew water over the edges.  I dislike freezer made ice, it's design is all wrong for a round glass.  My last portable ice maker, bullet style, finally corroded the wiring from its door condensation issue and wasn't worth the fix.  This ice melts slower than the bullet.

My wife is very happy to have it back in order with a working light and fan. The fan might not be the most quiet on the market but it is much better than what we had. I highly recommend this product and seller.,8/18/15,POSITIVE

Life really is good when you have pedestals to raise the washer and dryer to a Laundromat type level. It is so much easier to get wash in and out of the washer and dryer. Before I was really having trouble with my old washer and dryer, mostly because the buttons were not working right and it was difficult to get clothes out of the washer and into the dryer.<br /><br />Now as far as research goes I read all about this set before I bought it. It had all the fun features I knew I'd love. But it was a surprise when I heard all the cute sounds this washer and dryer make. There are little tunes that are played at the end of the cycles which makes me happy. It is so much better than an annoying beeping sound.<br /><br />I would have to say that \\""user friendly\\"" is an understatement when talking about how easy this set is to use. With just a few turns of a knob and the pressing of a few buttons you can customize your experience. I have tried about ten options on the washer so far but there are even more to try. You can do regular cycles like cotton or perma press or delicates. There are also cycles for towels and whites. If you have allergies you will love the allergiene cycle which does take about an hour and a half but leaves sheets very, very clean. There is also a sanitary cycle a heavy duty cycle and speed wash cycle. I tried the speed wash cycle and it was only fifteen minutes. This was handy as I just needed to wash a few items. Now I don't have to wait for my favorite clothes. I can wash and dry them very quickly.<br /><br />The only cycle I had issues with on the washer was the perma press cycle with cold water. I tried washing my husband's and my clothes together and with cold water the scent of his deodorant got on all my clothes. So next I did a prewash (with Clorox 2) and extra rinse and used warm water. That turned out great and my clothes were fresh and clean. So I don't think I'll be using cold water as much with this machine. The washer also has a rinse and spin cycle but not a simple spin cycle.<br /><br />The only thing I had trouble washing so far was a very heavy flannel duvet/comforter cover. It simply would not spin. So I had to wring it out in the bathtub and finally got enough water out of it so I could put it in the dryer. So when they say \\""bulky\\"" items not everything heavy is going to work. But small blankets came out great. Like the kind you use on a baby's bed or cat bed.<br /><br />The washer also has a child lock option for if you have small kids. There is also an option to customize a cycle. So if you do a similar kind of laundry all the time this will save you some time as it saves your cycle and remembers it.<br /><br />The dryer is also very easy to use. You can turn a knob to select steam, small load, heavy duty, bulky/large, perm press, delicates, towels, speed dry and air dry. There is also a way to download another cycle of your choice. Both the washer and dryer work with cell phones. You can select a cycle and then change the dry level, temperature, time and signal. The dryer comes with a rack so you can dry shoes or delicates that you have to lay flat. There is an easy iron option if you don't want clothes you want to iron to dry completely before ironing. And there is a cool wrinkle care option that will tumble clothes longer until you get the chance to get them out of the dryer.<br /><br />What I really like about both the washer and dryer is the indicator symbol lights. You always know how much time is left and you can see a little symbol that tells you how far along the cycle is. There is also a child lock feature on the dryer. The dryer also has a custom setting for your favorite cycle. For safety there is a little \\""flow sense duct blockage sensing system.\\""<br /><br />Really this washer and dryer have it all. Just make sure to really read the manuals before using. There are some safety issues like you want to disconnect the power when cleaning the filter on the washer, etc. The dryer filter is also very easy to clean.<br /><br />If housekeeping seems like drudgery to you trust me when I say that once you get this washer and dryer laundry will become fun again. What was the most fun was fluffing up my feather pillows on air dry. That only took a few minutes.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewfety issues like you want to disconnect the power when cleaning the filter on the washer, etc. The dryer filter is also very easy to clean.<br /><br />If housekeeping seems like drudgery to you trust me when I say that once you get this washer and dryer laundry will become fun again.

Installing this was a frustrating experience.  And I am an engineer myself and thought i had all the right parts, but found out I was wrong.  I even called Tech Support to explain and complain.  They were able to track down why I was having issues.  Here is what you need to know:  1. One port is slightly larger than the other, as they made this unit only to be mounted in non-flex 4&#34; duct.  However, the box is symmetrical and neither port is marked.  One is 4' in exterior diameter and the other is about 3.85&#34; in diameter.  No markings of any kind, so beware of this point, as once you remove the face/inner filter, it is easy to get the box turned around.  2. As I pointed out to Tech Support and they agree, but have no explanation for WHY - the lint filter, which is attached to the face of the unit at the same angle as the handle, DOES NOT TOUCH THE BACK OF THE BOX.  Thus, there is an air gap of about 1/4&#34; to 3/8&#34; between the inner edge of the lint filter and the back of the box.  This provides a LINT BYPASS which makes no sense at all.  It is, after all, a lint trap.  Tech Support is aware that customers are frustrated by this and resolving it with peel and stick foam window insulation, which is $2.50 per roll.  3. Tech Support is also aware that the face of the box leaks air.  Once again, you have to use some foam window seal tape, such as MD foam window seal for Small Gaps, or similar product.  What is not clear until you get one in hand, is that you pull on the handle and the whole front (white) face of the box comes out and the filter is attached perpendicular to the face.  So, if the face does not fit tight, it leaks.  And that means it leaks hot air into your space, and for many, it means it leaks RADON GAS into your space.  Not a lot, but in some areas we have radon in the ground water, and when you dry clothes, you want that hot moist air, which could contain radon, to vent outside, not leak into your garage or utility room or condo.  In short, we spent 3 hours modifying (insulating) and installing and field engineering this to get it to work.  It is installed and working now and catching lint.  But, for the price, this product should include the following:  * 2 - 4&#34; screw clamps * 2- 4&#34; sleeve adapters (almost impossible to install without this!) * 4 mounting screws * one roll of self adhesive foam insulation tape and instructions on how to add it to the lint filter and the door face - BETTER YET, install this  at the factory in China and make the box air tight BEFORE you sell it! * Better instructions.  Nowhere in the instructions are the problems described above mentioned, nor is there any info that points out that one port is narrower than the other and should be used as the INLET (they look the same until you measure them, but they are different diameters).  The instructions only cover installation for fixed 4&#34; duct with an inline fan, and not for other applications.  Duh!  Why not?  All in all this product is barely usable for my application as a secondary lint filter with flex connectors on each side, but yet this is EXTREMELY COMMON APPLICATION.  The manufacturer needs to rework this product to make it easier to use and make it more comprehensive.  Buyer beware.  You will need a lot of extra parts and pieces to make this work.",8/17/15,NEGATIVE

I bought this refrigerator at a very reputable appliance store. The day they delivered I noticed that 2 of the 3 doors had indentations in them. Not an obvious dent but if you looked at the doors the right way you could see large indentations in the metal and it was like that straight from the factory. The store said they would replace the doors no problem, only issue is that it took almost 6 weeks for Kitchen Aid to send them the new doors. Also on day one the cover for the meat draw did not fit at all and would not stay on. They ordered a new one of those too. Not what you would expect on an expensive refrigerator.<br /><br />When they came to replace the doors I noticed right away that the new freezer door had a similar indentation in the same spot but it wasn't as noticeable. The service technician told me it's almost impossible to get a door on one of these that does not at least have a slight indentation in that spot (bottom middle of the freezer door) so I just accepted it not wanting to go through the hassle again. He also had two new meat draw covers. Neither of them fit! The next step now was to order and replace the side rails for the draw. Weeks later they came and replaced the rails that the cover connects to and it still did not work. After several more weeks of waiting they came back with some plastic washers, disassembled the entire meat draw again and added the washers. The meat draw cover STILL does not work. You can barley get it on and then it pops off as soon as you pull the draw open.<br /><br />About a week later I opened the left door and the head of one of the screws in the bottom door hinge popped off which resulted in another service call to have the old screw drilled out and replaced with a new one.<br /><br />So 6 months since purchase I've had the dealer here (including the owner) probably 6 times and still do not have a working cover to the meat draw.<br /><br />I will never buy aKitchen Aid appliance again.",8/16/15,NEGATIVE

Unfortunately this is only a temporary fix since it continues. My heater element was fine, temp sensor fine, ice just keeps building up in the top section and plugs the fan. There was a class action law suit on this but Samsung refuses to help folks resolve their design flaw. I see mine has a heater to drain element added in the design from the earlier models, but that only helps with the lower half of the coils. Sad to spend so much on a fine looking fridge to have it be a lemon and not be supported by Samsung even though they know they have a bad design.<br /><br />Also, the spring for the door flap broke which seals the 2 French doors. It was cheap to fix, but Samsung used poor quality metal in the spring and it's a cheapo design that is not robust. So plan on fixing the door flap after about 2-3 years.<br /><br />I really want to like this refrigerator since the features are nice and it's a good layout. I like the LED. Most early reviews are favorable since they haven't had the defrost fail yet. So I thought I check in after 4 years and warn folks. Google this problem and you'll see. Samsung continues to use this faulty design as far as I can see, so BUYER BEWARE.<br /><br />I will not be buying any more Samsung devices. No more phone will be Apple after the S3 is done, no more Ovens, no more TVs, Samsung is a real fail.",8/16/15,NEGATIVE

Same as the rinse cycle in a normal washer.<br /><br />The only con I would give would be the hoses. They work just fine but they're the typical plastic hoses that you know are going to break eventually.

I replied that a year and a half product should not have done this no matter what the timeframe. They asked what I wanted done and I told them I wanted a replacement and they said they would call me back. I didn't hear from them for a week and when I called back they said the would call back with the name of an authorized dealer to get it fixed.

I can't believe it is a GE. I had to replace our wonderful Asko after many years of good service. Because our counters are 1/2&#34; too low for standard height dishwashers and we live in a remote area, I had very limited choices available that I could buy online and I couldn't actually see it before I bought it. After one load, I can make only two positive points: 1) the unit fits under our counter, and 2) a reasonably gooey load of dishes did get clean and reasonably dry. The racks, rollers, utensil baskets and spray arms are made of flimsy plastic. Although the unit is the same size as the Asko, the racks are only 17&#34; deep (instead of 19&#34;). The top one only pulls out part way, reducing capacity and making it hard to load and unload. I don't know what &#34;fully integrated&#34; means. It does NOT mean quiet. After rattling and roaring on for nearly 2 hours on the first load, the wretched thing created a further commotion by flashing a whole string of green lights and making intermittent beeping sounds to celebrate the fact that it had completed its cycle.  This continued until I got up and manually turned it off. I'm glad it was happy, because I just wanted to cry. As for Square Trade, the jury is out. They promised &#34;same day&#34; shipping on July 19. It shipped on July 28 and finally arrived on August 4. The 3-year Square Trade Large Appliance Protection policy has yet to arrive. Somehow, I suspect I'm going to need it, although I might be happier just letting the thing die an early death. I would wait to write this review until I had more to report, but I've given myself only 48 hours to think about how annoying this dishwasher is before I pretend it just doesn't exist.",8/15/15,NEGATIVE

Do you enjoy colonoscopies without sedation? If yes to either question Then by George an LG Washing Machine would be right for you!<br />I had been tickled pink by my LG washer & dryer set for about 2 years. Until said washing machine flooded our townhouse whilst I was running it's Tub Clean cycle. If you own an LG washing machine, by the way, you will get to know that Tub Clean cycle Rather well as the unit constantly smells of rotting eggs. Anyway, this particular morning the washing machine decided to spew forth a torrential downpour that caused it to rain through the 2nd floor laundry area into our ground floor foyer/garage area. Did I mention the ankle deep river with a current that was our upstairs hallway?!? I probably should reference that... Even with the almost immediate shut off of all water to the house, the impact was significant.  All in all: about $14000 worth of damages to the home.<br />LG customer service has been horrific. They continued to reference the event as a &#34;leak&#34; despite my repeated efforts to semantically clarify the incident. LG has taken the stance that as the unit was out of warranty, they &#34;can not be responsuble&#34; for its malfunction or ensuing damages. They have refused to pay for/ assist with our homeowners deductible  &  even charged me over $200 for a &#34;service visit&#34; for repairs to the machine wherein I was told there appeared to be nothing wrong with the unit. Moreover, I &#34;shouldn't worry&#34; about using it in the future. He changed an overflow valve Anyway even though it did not appear to be damaged. Oookkkkaayyy. I feel super confident now with my sparkly front load LG tsunami maker because DUH, I Shouldn't Worry, right?!? Besides, LG stands by the &#34;repair&#34; for 90 days.<br /><br />So YES, if you like living dangerously & want a major appliance within your household to be manufactured  by a company that behaves in a manner consistent with a sociopath, then splurge & get this LG Washing Machine.",8/14/15,POSITIVE

So the fact at the time of writing this review the price is at 394.51 with free shipping is INSANE! So if the price doesn't drop go buy a Sonya at http://amzn.to/1HM4D2V in retrospect I think they got a larger capacity in the Sonya.<br /><br />FIRST CONTACT: This arrived is perfect shape, no dents, no nothing. At first it did make a slightly weird sound, but it resolved itself right away (maybe the belt was slightly off?) Anyway it heats up very well, but ventilation is kind of tricky (if your not very hands on). The back vent is just a circle extruded out, and it comes with the oval shaped exhaust vent which I personally found to be 100% useless.<br /><br />THE EXHAUST: The circular exhaust doesn't stick out much so it was kind of difficult for me to zip tie a hose to it, but I managed to do it, and it works great. You must find some way to expel the exhaust otherwise the dryer will suck the moisture back in from the front intake vent, and yeah your cloths will never dry this way.<br /><br />BUTTON LOCATIONS: Okay so this is kind of annoying, but I guess its whatever. The heat knob is located in the bottom right which means you need to pretty much be on the floor when turning the dial. The button to the left of this the one you press allows you to switch from automatic heat or timed heat. Personally timed heat I think works best, but the auto is good to save energy since the unit has a built in moisture sensor you just turn the dial knob all the way up to 200 minutes with the button depressed, and it will start auto drying.<br /><br />CAPACITY: I would say it has plenty. If your doing blankets you got to do one at a time if they are king size since they will pretty much take up the whole dryer.<br /><br />LINT FILTER: The filter is located in center of the drum you just reach in and pull is straight towards you and it will pop out. It will feel like your going to great it, but trust me you won't. When they say clean the filter they mean clean the dang filter. If you don't keep up with the filter you will be 100% disappointed with this dryer. If you clean it before every load, or after every load than you will be a happy camper.<br /><br />SHIPPING: When the FedEx guy came to the front, and slammed it down (not literally, but it was a light drop). I was concerned about how it would perform after some rough shipping. It preformed great, and was packaged well (I thought it was anyway).<br /><br />Quality of drying a normal load: Simply put it dryers 1-2 loads of very well, but keep up with the filter, and make sure it is proper ventilated.<br /><br />REASON FOR 4 STARS: Button location - Okay so if you got this on the Avanti stand that allows you to have it up in the air than the button location probably is not a problem, and the fact that they are on the bottom would be of benefit.

It died on Tuesday and I had this one delivered to my front door Thursday morning. The one I had, the dryer stopped working right after a year. Some things you can fix yourself - it's not that complex of a washer/dryer, but after emailing back and forth with the seller we realized it wasn't something simple. I hardly just wanted to toss the unit so I kept using the washer part for several years and I would just ring out my clothes. It was a pretty good little washer. But Tuesday I had run it for hours, there was a lot of laundry. I finally finished my last load and the machine was off. I was sitting in the living room when I heard a funny noise in the kitchen. I got up to go see what it was and walked in just in time to see sparks shoot out the back. In the outlet I just had plugged in the washer/dryer and microwave. Neither one were running at the time. I quickly pulled both cords out and it blew that breaker. Smoke was coming from my machine. Luckily it's so lightweight I could easily drag it outside. Even after it sat out there for an hour, the machine still had a kind of burning electrical smell. I carried it out to the dumpster and that was that.<br /><br />I got on Amazon and started shopping and even after all that, I still love this style of washer/dryer. Many people have them and if my experience was indicative of this machine, there would be more people talking about it. It could happen with any appliance - and I did work this washer hard on a regular basis. It gave me a lot of good use and I enjoyed having it. When I found this listing, I knew it was the one. The seller got it here super-fast and I got to test this one out last night. While it looks the same, it ran different but better. The agitation is much stronger. I put the same amount of soap in the first load but the suds went all crazy. It was full of suds. I had to scoop them out then run it again after filling only with cold water. I'll use about 1/4 of the detergent in this one than what I used in the old one. I also lifted up the lid while it was washing and holy heck, it really was moving everything around a lot. They may have improved upon this washer in the last few years. I also tested out the dryer. On my old one, it seemed that plastic insert thing would frequently get off balanced (when it was still working). I was almost afraid to test it, to ruin the &#34;magic&#34; because I was so happy about having a washer. Upon testing it, it stayed balanced and squeezed all the moisture out. So far, I'm pretty thrilled!<br /><br />Update: I just wanted to come back real quick to say I'm still loving this washer/dryer combo! My clothes are much cleaner. Also, I noticed there is this lip going around the top of the spin/dry barrel I hadn't seen in my last unit. It makes it less likely the plastic insert would come out by accident.

So far, I'm pretty thrilled!<br /><br />Update: I just wanted to come back real quick to say I'm still loving this washer/dryer combo! My clothes are much cleaner. Also, I noticed there is this lip going around the top of the spin/dry barrel I hadn't seen in my last unit. It makes it less likely the plastic insert would come out by accident. I feel convinced now they did make improvements over the years.",8/14/15,POSITIVE

I read great reviews but am disappointed after using the machine. It's just too much work for washing 2 or 3 pieces of clothing at a time. The washing cycle is max 15 mins long which isn't enough sometimes. And there are so many soap suds in the clothes after draining a washing cycle, that I either have to take out the clothes and rinse them in the sink by hand before putting them in the spin dryer, or I have to repeat the washing cycle 2 or 3 times after draining the first cycle to rinse all the soap out of the clothes. And then the clothes have to transferred out of the washing bin into the spinning bin. And then after spinning they have to be hung up to dry or put in a separate dryer machine. A narrow undetachable u-shaped hook is fit on the draining pipe which adds an unnecessary kink to it and slows it's drainage. Plus the hook is so narrow it won't fit over my bathtub, bathroom sink or kitchen sink. When I turn on the drain, the water gushes out the drain pipe so fast that the drain pipe will jump out of the bathtub and onto the floor (making an awful mess) unless I place something heavy on the drain pipe to keep it in place. Overall too much hassle. I still use it to wash small items that I don't want to mix with a load of laundry, like a new shirt that may wash out a lot of color, or when i need to wash one item without waiting to gather a load. But otherwise I have gone back to gathering loads of laundry over weeks and hauling it to the public machines.",8/13/15,NEGATIVE

(3) Then the &#34;low-washer&#34; feature seems to be a joke, as it should be called, &#34;not enough water&#34;.  It takes FOREVER tomplete a wash cycle.  Often, the dark clothes have white marks from the detergent, the clothes are not clean, and they really don't smell clean at all.

I'm wondering if this might work, even though it sounds like a pain to do.  The Whirlpool guide specifically says to NOT add additional water to the tub, but I'm wondering if that actually might work.<br />Has anyone found a way to make this machine actually work, as I can't afford to just throw it away and get a new machine.  At this point, I'm definitely NOT a Whirlpool fan.",8/13/15,NEGATIVE

You will need to get used to a new way of doing laundry, but once you learn all the functions, and how the washer works, (leave it alone, it knows what its doing..) you are going to be happy you made this choice like I was.  I will suggest to buy the warranty on the washer even if you are not a warranty person.  Skip the warranty on the dryer, it is an uncomplicated appliance but the washer needs a warranty as far more complicated to repair and more expensive. Has lovely tones that go off when your load is starting a new function and when the load is done. Washer lid locks when the load starts, but easy to pause and it will click open if you need to add something you forgot.  I prefer to use laundry pac soaps dropped directly in the tub as keeps the washer cleaner, but you can use liquids and powders as well in special drawer type cups. Also has a cup for bleach.  LOVE the &quot;bedding&quot; selection for blankets, sheets, even pillows.  The nice big stainless tub is gorgeous!  I know, I know, it's just a washer, but I am so proud of this washer!",8/13/15,POSITIVE

Well not little, it was actually quite big, which was great because I thought it would hold a lot less clothing. Very light and easy to operate. I washed 4 loads right out the box and the spinner was amazing. It pretty much dried out my clothes. DO NOT expect this to heat dry your clothes. Its a spin dryer like the spin cycle on a regular washer. Noise is not bad, It does make some so don't expect it to be silent. Make sure the hose is up and on normal when you are filling it or it would spill out (Learned that the hard way.) Also the hose does not fit my sink. I did not have a problem with that because I just filled it with a bucket as in my opinion, it would take forever with the hose. I also wash in my bathtub because when draining, the hose needs to be leveled and is on the bottom. If anything, that would be the only issue I have with this washer. The hose should've been on top for easy draining. Little bit of soap goes a long way. I washed shirts, socks, undies, hand towels and wash cloths. Tonight I will try jeans and towels and see how that works. Clothes do get tangled so get a mesh bag to prevent it. Overall, This machine gets 5 stars. I wanted to get a Panda, since it seems to be the top of the line twin tub washer but I couldn't afford 200+shipping. I'm hoping this lasts a while. I will check in with another update soon via video so people can see how this beauty works! If you know what to expect using these, I suggest this. If you don't know much about these machines, please YouTube it before buying. Some people expect too much but this is EXACTLY what I expected and I'm satisfied.",8/13/15,POSITIVE

Simplicity At Its Finest,"This refrigerator does not have a water dispenser in the door, or an icemaker in the freezer, or multiple doors to access your food. It's a solid, basic, ergonomically-correct refrigerator that's quiet, keeps our food cold, and looks great in stainless steel. Plus I love the 18 cu ft size because it's roomy inside but does not overpower the kitchen. A simple digital display inside the fridge shows the temp setting for both the fridge and the freezer, with easy up-down arrows to change (4 is recommended). The fridge itself has everything at eye level for easy finding and reach. The bottom freezer pulls straight out like a big smooth drawer for easy access to a top and bottom wire rack. Personally I removed the plastic dividers inside the freezer racks to accommodate/make more room for odd-shaped stuff. Just a great fridge.  Remember when kitchen appliances were quality-made and lasted for years? Ah the last of a dying breed, get it while you can. By the way Amana is owned by Whirlpool.",8/12/15,POSITIVE

This problem is made much more annoying by the fact that it's constantly getting itself turned on when you brush against it and then when you accidentally activate the start button (also easy to do by brushing against it) it stubbornly refuses to let you cancel whatever random settings (also easy to set by brushing against it) it had at the moment you accidentally started it. I've tried turning it off, pulling the plug out, but nothing works. Didn't they test this design in actual day-to-day use and notice this design problem??? All these settings and on/off buttons are right on the top where you would expect to brush against them all the time. And this problem happens all the time. Right now I have a load accidentally running on delicate setting. I'm just hoping I don't have to run it all through again as, even on auto setting it's been known not to clean thoroughly. Often I have a mostly empty dishwasher that I'm not ready to start but is determined to go on.<br /><br />Design suggestion for Bosch, make it so the touch sensitive buttons are recessed.

All this means that instead of the stacked set being 10&#34; deeper then the measurements when installed they are only 1&#34; more than the actual machine measurements. Because of where our set is installed this was paramount to our decision on what brand to buy. Other things we like are the push to open doors; very helpful if you have your hands full of laundry and for keeping the smaller kids from opening the washer. The door opening is also at least 2&#34; larger than most other brands.",8/12/15,POSITIVE

On the black model, the sides and top are textured, and the front is smooth metal. The smooth metal will show every finger print.<br /><br />The reason I chose this model (besides being an LG) was that it has no handles that stick out, they are recessed. And the way the door is made, you can make this a right hinge model or a left hinge model to suit your kitchen. It's a good thing this doesn't have handles because the fridge is THICK. It sticks out a good 8&#34; past my kitchen cabinets. My old fridge was wider and more flush with the cabinets.<br /><br />I love the interior. The LED lights (both compartments) are bright. The pantry drawer holds all my cheese, lunch meats, butter, etc.,and you can see it from above through the shelf above it. The bottom shelf on the door is perfect for holding beer bottles or soft drink cans. My old fridge was about the same cubic footage but this is designed better (my old one was a side-by-side).<br /><br />This fridge is plenty cold. I leave the refrigerator section at &#34;medium&#34; and I had to turn the freezer compartment down to 2 because 3 (medium) was freezing the ice cream so hard it was bending my spoons when trying to get it out of the carton.

Smooth black on front shows finger prints.<br />2. The bottom door is closer to the floor (no grill under in front), so you need to watch your bare feet when opening the door or you'll hit the top of your foot (ouch!)<br />3.  If you close the bottom door too hard, the freezer compartment door will come open an inch or so, but quickly closes on its own.  It's pressure equalization and not a big deal to me.

This review is not for a verified purchase because I received the dishwasher as a gift from my parents. The most thoughtful gift I think I have ever received! My house is nearly 100 years old and the kitchen is almost all original. I have all of three outlets in the kitchen and one doesn't work unless the hallway light is on. Ha.<br /><br />The nice 18&#34; width means I can roll it away between my stove and my fridge, and it's tall enough to be level with the stove so I can use the top of the washer as counter space.<br /><br />I've been using my Danby for more than three years now. It's been great! The lighter load settings work well for lightly soiled dishes, but if you let them sit for a little too long like I have a tendency to do, the heavy load almost always does the trick.<br /><br />Cons: sometimes if you load the bottom rack with heavy plates, it will come off the track. Just while you are pushing the rack in, not while washing.<br />  Some heavily soiled dishes don't come out clean but that's true of all washers.<br />  Dishwasher salt is expensive. Someone told me you can use plain (no iodine) salt, but that voids any warranty so use at your own risk.<br />  Took me a while to learn all the different symbols. I had to check the manual a lot.<br />  NOT for a large family unless you are in a pinch and desperate.<br /><br />Pros:  Easy to set up and use<br />  Easy to keep the filters and arms clean, everything easy to remove and replace.<br />  Cleans really well<br />  Perfect for small kitchens or rentals where you can't install an undercounter dishwasher.<br /><br />I have had zero problems with this unit until a few days ago a small piece in the handle broke, so I had to pry the door open with a hammer! Quick removal of the door panel revealed the problem and a short internet search and I had my $4.70 handle assembly ordered. So relatively inexpensive replacement parts and ease of replacing is another pro.",8/12/15,POSITIVE

Yes, it gets cold and keeps cold, but there are just too many ways in which this should have been better.<br /><br />Let's start off with its capacity. 62 quarts sounds like a lot, but you very soon realize it's not distributed properly. Neither the small nor the large compartments will take a standard grocery bag, and both compartments accommodate only tall and narrow items. That means when you drag your groceries out to the car, you have to unpack them to get them into these compartments! Then when you get home, you have 2 choices:<br />1. Lift out the internal baskets and take them inside, unpack the baskets into your refrigerator and freezer, and then return the baskets to this machine in your car, or<br />2. Unpack the baskets into the grocery bags you first unpacked at the store, and then bring the grocery bags inside for redistribution of their contents once again.<br /><br />Another problem this machine has is the time it takes to get cold. I leave mine in the back of my Suburban, but when I want to run to the store, I can't just plug it into the power port because it takes 2 hours for it to get cold enough to use! So now what I do is to leave both the included AC cord and the DC power port cord plugged into the machine. When I am planning to go to the store, I run an extension cord out to the Sub and plug in the AC cord. Letting it run for 2 hours, I can then start the car, plug in the DC power port cord, unplug and put away the AC power cord, and head for the store. Sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it? It's certainly more work than it should be!<br /><br />There's a minor quibble I have with the way Amazon ships these machines. They weigh in at 66 pounds, empty, and Amazon ships them as though they're 82 pounds. If you get this box and you don't like it, don't ask Amazon to charge you for shipping it back, because the difference between actual and listed weights will cost you a pretty penny!<br /><br />Another shortcoming is the plastic handles. Much has been made by other reviewers about the lack of durability with these handles, and they really do feel flimsy. I've been careful with mine, and so far there's been no trouble with them. But by no means do I trust them to be strong!<br /><br />This machine could have been so much better with 2 adjustments. First, it should be able to fit a standard grocery bag in each compartment without unpacking them. I certainly understand the aim of having so much insulation around each compartment, but I would have been more than happy to sacrifice a bit of efficiency for better packability. Second, this machine should have a turbo mode when on AC power. That would allow the unit to come down in temperature much more quickly before being asked to maintain those temperatures on DC power. If those 2 changes had been made before making this machine available to the market, I could easily have forgiven the problem with the handles.<br /><br />At more than $600, the value is not quite there for this machine, unless perhaps you have specific uses for it that do not match mine. My advice is to be extremely sure this machine will fit your needs before you try it out.y!<br /><br />Another shortcoming is the plastic handles.

Some of you who are still reading this lengthy review may wonder, why someone would spend money on a small washing machine, while waiting for delivery of a large washer.  I am sure all regions are different, but I recently went to a laundry mat and spent $85 to wash and dry 14 loads of laundry.  The Eco-Egg can handle most of our typical summer loads with the exception of bed linens, sheets and bath towels.  Since I wash and dry about 7 loads per week, the Eco-Egg Washer should save me about $30 per week in laundry mat expenses.  2.  Cord Length:  First of all, the cord is heavy duty and approximately a good 93 inches long, depending on how one measures it.  3.  Washing:  It seems to wash like a high efficiency washing machine.  I use a  quality brand name HE detergent and get excellent cleaning results.  4.  Washing Example:  I used a couple of white rags to clean the floor, where an old washer, which had been in the same spot for 16 years resided.  Anyway, one can only imagine the amount of accumulated dust and dirt which accumulated underneath that old washer.  Due to the extreme dirt, I did two &#34;wash only&#34; cycles in hot water using the Laundry Alternative Eco-egg Automatic Mini Washing Machine.  Then I did a quick rinse.  Then I ran the Eco-Egg on the full automatic cycle with HE detergent and some bleach.  The filthy rags are white again.  Now that is amazing for a small washer that cost about $121, including tax.  5.  Load Size:  Here are several examples of the size of loads it has done.   Load 1:  Five pairs of white crew socks   Load 2:  4 wash clothes and one hand towel   Load 3:  One pair of Large cotton stretch shorts and one L cotton t-shirt   Load 4:  One pair of Large heavy duty cotton men's walking shorts   Load 5:  One XL rayon top(NOTE:  The rayon is a thin fabric.) and one XL stretch cotton capris.   Load 6:  Four white 15 inch X 10 inch thin cotton cleaning rags   Load 7:  2 Men's Large cotton t-shirts and 2 sweatbands   Load 8:  4 pairs of Men's cotton brief underwear  Timing for the above 8 loads:  If you only use the wash cycle, hand wring them out and hand rinse them in a sink bowl of water.  The above eight loads can be washed, hand rung and rinsed in about 80 minutes to 120 minutes, depending on how you use the machine.  Timing for one load:  If you use the automatic cycle, one load takes about 35 minutes to automatically wash and automatically rinse each load.  Then, you will need about two minutes in-between loads to wring out the loads before you dry them on a line or dry them in a dryer.  So, for 8 small loads the rinsing, washing and wringing will take about 5 hours.  On the bright side, one can do other things while the washer automatically washes the small loads.  6.  Conclusion:  The wringing takes a little more work than with a $600 Washing machine which spins out the water, but this washer does not cost that much.  I did not mind wringing out the clothes.   I liked this small washer so much, that I bought a small oak stand for which it to sit in the bathroom next to the sink. I hope to use it for certain small loads for the rest of my laundry  life.    To the Engineer of this small washer:  Thank you for the design.  It is perfect.  I hope you consider making these Eco-Egg Washers in 2 sizes.

Bosch = 23-3/4&#34; in depth.<br />2) Price should not exceed $800 installed. Paid: $719 (+ TAX) + installation and haul away were on special...FREE! (saved $120)<br />3) MUST HAVE Stainless Steel Tub. YES<br />4) Must dry thoroughly. Even though the Bosch lacks a visable heating coil, Drying is excellent. Note: CYCLES ARE VERY SLOW.<br /> 4b) Considering item 4 above, item SHOULD have delayed start times(this one does)...YES. Note: unit also has programmable shut off times.<br />5) Energy efficient. YES.<br />6) Sanitize function. YES<br />7)Quick wash. Yes...60 Minute cycle available...actual times vary (usually LONGER)!<br />8) Unit must have front panel time remaining lit display (top controls  sometimes melt w/ hot water temps)<br />All in all, the Bosch 300 met all of my own criteria + BOSCH MAKES ABOUT THE QUIETEST DISHWASHER IN THE MARKET, THAT I AM AWARE OF. The model 300 is no exception...sound level is advertised at 46db, which is almost 10db lower that the 12 yr old Bosch that it replaced! (I do not work for them either)<br />Note: as with most, this DW is made in different configurations. Mine had stainless steel exterior as well =as ss tub. This model is also available with top controls. I need and prefer front controls/display.<br />I shopped for weeks trying to find the ideal DW in my price range.

This is what I had expected.  I did some research and it seems Golden Vantage makes a wall mount hood that is identical.  My best guess is they took that hood and  put a ceiling mount bracket on the top.  Very very poor design.,8/10/15,POSITIVE

Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,4,282,284,N,N,I love this refrigerator and highly recommend it!! A few minor things prevent it from getting 5 stars.,"This review is for the Samsung counter depth refrigerator model number RF23J9011SR/AA.<br />*** UPDATED 9/28/15 with photos***<br />***UPDATED with some newly found issues: 8/19/15***<br /><br />We've had this refrigerator for about two weeks. Overall, we absolutely love it. We are a family of 4. We do not stock up on food. We tend to shop several times a week as we live very close to a grocery store. So the counter depth design not only looks great, it has plenty of space for us. So much so, that we have yet to come close to filling it. I believe it would be fine for families of our size that tend to stock up. The refrigerator section is wide and shallow keeping everything within easy reach and view. Hopefully this will cut down on forgotten leftovers hidden in the back that come to resemble biological experiments. The ice maker makes ice cubes at a rate that is on par with every other ice maker on the market including Sub-Zero (I'm getting about 160 cubes/day). The French door freezer design was my #1 reason for purchasing it. Each side of the freezer has two good-sized pull out drawers, a top pull out shelf and shelves in the door to keep everything organized. Each side of the freezer can be set to a different temperature. We use one side as a standard freezer for things like frozen veggies. The other side we set to &#34;Soft Freeze&#34; and use for meat, fish, and sandwich meat. The food doesn't freeze solid, but is kept really cold and fresh! So we gain more refrigerator space as we don't store any meat in that section. I love not having one, giant freezer drawer so that I don't have to bend over and dig for frozen food. Freezers with one big drawer also collect debris on the bottom: crumbs and hair. Yuk!<br /><br />There are a few, annoyances that, all tolled, keep me from giving it 5 stars:<br />1) The doors are not smudge/fingerprint free and require frequent wiping.<br />2) The recessed door handles, while they look stylish, are a bit of a pain. You can't grab them naturally with either hand. My 10 year old son was the first to point this out. You either have to open the right door with your left hand and vice versa or you have to twist your right hand with your thumb pointing down to open the right doors and similarly with the left.<br />3) None of the drawers pull out far enough. They all have a stop which I feel is too short.<br />4) This one is probably the biggest issue for me: With the ice dispense in crushed ice mode, a lot of crushed ice flies all over the floor unless you have a very wide mug or wide mouthed glass that are pressed right up to the opening. For normal sized glasses, ice goes all over.<br />5) There is a function on the control panel to lock it out so that someone can't change settings by accident (say, inadvertently touch the freezer temp control and change it). When I use that, then the ice and water dispenser stop working!!<br /><br />I'll be contacting Samsung about items 4 and 5 for sure. Hopefully they are defects that can be addressed with a service call. Lastly, and this one is very very minor, while it is generally very quite, it does emit a gurgling sound on occasion. I know for sure that it is not the water line because it made that sound before we even hooked it up.<br /><br />To address some issues I've read about in other reviews (from many different sites)<br />Issue 1) &#34;It only lasted a year and a half.&#34;: 2015 is the first year this model was released and there were no previous versions of it. So these reviews must be for the non-counter depth version of this model. The /AA in the model number indicates country of manufacture which is the USA. So the AA is not a version indicator.<br /><br />Issue 2) &#34;The outside sweats and drips water all over the floor.&#34;: The manual clearly states that if this happens, turn off the &#34;Energy Saver Mode.&#34; This could happen in humid environments.<br /><br />Issue 3) &#34;Ice cube making rate is slow.&#34;: There are severalissues here clearly addressed in the manual. First, upon installation, it may take several days before it makes ice cubes at its normal rate. Secondly, the rate is dependent upon the temperature to which you have the freezer set. Initially, our freezer was set to 0 degrees Fahrenheit and the rate was slow. I set it to -2 and am getting a rate of about 140-160 cubes per day which is the same as every other refrigerator on the market.<br /><br />Issue 4) &#34;You can't pull out the ice maker bucket to access the ice cubes en bulk.&#34; This one is just not true. Maybe they didn't pull hard enough or they are talking about a different model.<br /><br />About the attached photos: Upper section: There are about 20 condiment bottles on the 2 top-right door shelves alone with room for a couple more. The pot on the bottom-left is an 8.5 quart Calphalon dutch oven. The bottom-right shelf has 3 half-gallon milk containers, 1 one-gallon milk jug, a 90 oz jug of OJ and several other assorted bottles of water and gatorade. Egg cartons fit nicely under the icemaker. Bottom section: Bottom-right: Set to chill. We use it for meats, beer and other adult bevs we like ice cold. Bottom-left is freezer.

A tragic story indeed, but more tragic given that the freezer was 8 months old, and failed in such a catastrophic manner.

Check out my tips!!,"Right now I'm living in a house that has a washer and dryer hookup but I'm about to be downsizing to an apartment. Because of this I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a standard washer and dryer only to have no place to put it later. I read tons about this product and watched YouTube videos by alaskagranny before deciding to purchase one. This little washer is a powerhouse!! I actually don't mind doing laundry now when I used to hate it before. I've tested the limits of this little guy and found that although it's not recommended, it'll wash a queen sized duvet cover in a pinch! The spinner compartment holds more than you think it will but by packing it full, the clothes don't come out as dry. I spent the first few weeks learning just how big a load I could do without having to spin in multiple batches. I went to Walmart and purchased a large metal foldable drying rack before actually ordering the Panda lol! Once purchased I had it set up in the kitchen and used the hose it comes with. Afterwards I decided to put it in the laundry room and buy a washer hose hookup because the plastic hose it comes with cant handle high water pressure and makes filling up take longer. since using the washer hose, I can knock out a load of laundry much faster just from cutting down fill time. TIPS:: 1) Wash towels MAX 2 at a time and spin one at a time. 2) spin smaller loads to get more water out so they dry faster 3) don't put the drain hose up too high or it will not drain properly and will take forever 4) before hanging to dry, shake the crap out of everything that leaves the spinner. doing this, I have no issues with wrinkles! however hard you shake clothes, shake towels twice as hard! 5) ****I recommend spinning between the wash cycle and rinse cycle as this helps remove all of the soap and prevent your clothes from being crunchy!***** 6) I use powdered Gain and I use about a teaspoon+ per load give or take. and I use maybe a tablespoon of fabric softener in the rinse cycle.Follow these tips for a VERY satisfactory time using the Panda!  UPDATE 8-11-15: I tried the rinsing in the spinner method as indicated by another user and wow!! It works so well! Definitely use whatever method works for you and your situation. Rinsing while in the spinner is definitely at your own risk because the instruction state NOT to put water in the spinner, however there's an inlet on that side so obviously the originally intended it for that purpose.",8/9/15,POSITIVE

I used a credit card to pop it up at first, but eventually just made slits in the suction cups so they didn't work anymore, but still gripped because they're soft rubber. That worked just fine. No need for sticking them so hard to anything. Ever.<br /><br />-My first machine was defective. I heard a &#34;squealing&#34; sound. It was air escaping because the bottom piece had not been properly glued on. It eventually popped off, but they sent a new machine immediately, so it must have been a dud.<br /><br />-For some reason, I found this thing laborious. Put clothes in. Add water from bucket since it doesn't line up under the faucet/it gets really heavy when it fills halfway. Lid on. Turn a lot of times. Lid off. Drain. Add water to rinse. Lid on. Turn a lot of times. Lid off. Drain. Squeeze clothes out to hang (before I got the little dryer...which is amazing). It felt like it took forever and my back hurt from being bent over it constantly.<br /><br />-It's literally held together with a few plastic clips and a metal clip on either side. That's it. It gets pretty heavy when it's full of water and clothes and cannot take any serious movement any way or another before those little clips start popping out. I recommend gluing them in if you aren't going to be taking it apart for any reason.<br /><br />Anyway, like I said, I used this for about a month before switching to another product which did the washing for me and didn't quite as much babysitting.

So don't get this ice machine based on the amount it says it can make. I use it moderately for a 4 person family and run it consistently when guests are here just to keep the freezer replenished. With that being said, The ice tastes deliciously pure because i use purified water. It does have 3 sizes to choose from of bullet shaped ice with a hole that goes to the top but not completely through. Because of that, the ice will melt faster in a drink than a solid piece of ice. Which I don't mind. The ice maker itself is very durable. It is tall and you must have room to let the fan breathe or it will get to hot and it will take longer to make the ice and can ruin the machine itself.

I encourage you to read through all of the 1 star reviews.<br /><br />However, what I will relay to you is the current debacle of attempting to get a refund for the boat anchor Samsung KNOWINGLY sold me.  In fact, when you finish reading this review I suggest you do a search about the Class Action Lawsuit against Samsung.  These issues have continued for the better part of 5 years on a variety of refrigerators they continue to sell without revisions.  This is a company who clearly wanted to build a better mousetrap and has seriously FAILED.  These are bad guys here folks..... they are taking our hard earned money in exchange for one of the most vital home appliances you will own, knowing it WILL fail.  Not IF... WHEN.  This unit was deemed unrepairable by Samsungs &#34;Authorized Repair Company&#34;  I was given a 7000 number.  Now... I'm on hold again.<br /><br />I'm listening to the on hold music now for about the 8th time on hold now for the Executive Customer Relations department.  Don't hold your breath while you wait, I've logged over an hour on hold so far today.  The total time dealing with this issue is 7 days without a working fridge, and around 20 hours on the phone.  Needless to say this fleecing has me irate.  I intend to receive a full refund, as well as the cost of the food destroyed by this defect.  I will become their worst nightmare until I receive it.  If I need to take legal action, I will... on principle alone.  Buyer Beware.  Don't be allured by the beauty- it's a mirage.",8/8/15,NEGATIVE

I check the external cabinet temp regularly and while it does get quite warm to the touch, it seems to be okay installed as is.

This generally occurs when oven gets hot, but has also occurred when the stove has not been used at all.<br />During the 2-1/2 years I have owned this range, the door motor lock assembly has been replaced twice.

I contacted Electrolux to ask if they would transfer the extended warranty to a new user, and they absolutely refused, offering to cancel my extended warranty as their solution to my dissatisfaction with the stove.<br />My conscience would take too much of a beating if I were to even offer this thing as a donation, since it would likely precipitate hundreds of dollars of repairs and weeks of disuse to an unsuspecting buyer, so it‚Äôs being rendered unsellable and good for recycle of its metal only.<br />It goes without saying that I would never purchase another appliance manufactured by Electrolux or one of its subsidiaries.",8/8/15,NEGATIVE

Occasionally, when I use the high water setting I will get a small bit of water on the floor. I believe that's my fault because I fill the clothes a bit too high. It never happens on medium water level. Its such a small amount that its easy to clean with a towel. I can't blame the machine for my mistake.<br />I highly recommend this machine.<br /><br />*UPDATE* 11/2016<br />I've had this machine for 2 years now and it is still working flawlessly. I've read some of the negative reviews and I'm updating because maybe I can help with some extra info.<br />First off, it's important to keep the wash loads small. This is the most important factor in success with this machine. If you overload it, you will have water overflow. You will also be stressing the machine, forcing it to work harder than it's intended to, resulting in problems.<br /><br />Second, regarding water level. AGAIN, don't overload the machine. ALSO, make sure you add the clothes BEFORE the water is full. If you want to add enough water to dilute your detergent or bleach (As I do), let it fill 3 or 4 inches and then get the clothes in there.<br />If you let the water reach it's level and then add the clothes, you are going to force the water over the top.So make sure to put the clothes in when the water level is still low. If you err on the side of caution and use smaller loads you will gradually figure out exactly how much you can put in one load.",8/8/15,POSITIVE

2950,US,33841489,R2FZCQYZ2NJ9ZP,B00ZZEFTPC,869887540,"Igloo 5.1 cu ft Chest Freezer, Black",Major Appliances,3,14,20,N,N,Flawed but Tolerable (Warning: Internet Width Dimensions Are Listed Incorrectly!),"CON: The most important thing to know about this chest freezer is someone typed a 1 instead of a 2 in the width section of dimensions, so instead of being 19&#34; wide like the description says everywhere we've looked--from Amazon to Walmart--the darn thing is actually 29&#34; wide. Like most people, we carefully chose where this sizable appliance would go, so being surprised with an almost extra foot in width was infuriating. Fortunately, we were able to make it work without it looking too horrible. Granted, where we had to put it doesn't look nearly as good as the planned 19&#34; would have, but since it's not enclosed by a wall or other appliance on either side, we, like I said, made it work and are living with it. Had we known the true measurements, however, we would have reconsidered making the purchase.  Con: Another really annoying thing is one of the big, ugly, yellow stickers on the side has proven impossible to remove. It's the cheapest, stickiest, nastiest type of sticker adhesive. It broke my nails, and my husband has thick nails, but he had no luck either. We're going to try soaking it with warm wash cloths in hopes of removing the top layer of paper; then we'll resort to Goo Gone. It's aggravating that we have to deal with this, let alone by using an adhesive remover. Goo Gone works the best, but it smells gross, lingers for sometimes months after the fact, and tends to cause sinus headaches. I hate having to use it, especially inside, but short of leaving the shredded mess on our pretty, new chest freezer, which we won't do, we have no choice. We don't understand why one sticker was easy to remove but the other has been beastly. Perhaps they came from different printers.  Con: Another eye sore, and more permanent than an ugly sticker, is that the thick power cord comes out the side instead of the back. Unless you plan on butting your chest freezer into a corner, which we aren't, then it's less than attractive. If Igloo cares so little for aesthetics,why even make one in black?  Con: As warned by seemingly 9 out of every 10 reviews, it came with a few dings, but they're towards the bottom, small, and don't include scratched paint, so it's not that obvious and, like the width, is tolerable.  Con: Without anything in it, this chest freezer is reported to weigh 100 lb. Add food to the fact that it has no wheels and you've got a heavy problem when it comes to cleaning the back and, more importantly, the strip of exposed floor behind it. Worse than not having wheels, the outlet side doesn't even have feet and is instead a strip of metal, serving both as structural support to house the compressor unit and, dimwittedly, a single &#34;foot&#34; on that side. We aren't even sure it's metal and think, from the look and feel of it, that it's plate aluminum. It's thick but still soft enough to leave marks on your tile over time, that is if you're trying to move it back and forth to clean, which repairmen recommend when it comes to keeping appliances efficient. The lack of feet on all four corners may not matter to some people, like if you're sticking it against a wall and won't ever see behind it, but like other reviewers, we bought this in black to match our kitchen appliances, so it's backed against the end of our counter. There's a 3&#34; x 29&#34; strip of exposed tile in the back (not 19&#34; like it says, remember), where dust visibly collects, plus appliances attract dust up their backsides. Ultimately, casters (i.e. ball feet) would've been best, but at the very least four dependable feet would've been nice and would've made it to where you could move the unit without risk to flooring.  Con: The silver coating that lines the inside has a few surface abrasions, but they aren't glaring and don't seem to affect the freezer's efficacy.  Con: As reported by others, it does run quietly; however, the compressor does have a slight vibrating whistle to it. Hopefully, this does not intensify over time. Let's just say we're glad we bought the extended warranty.  Con: The controls are on the bottom corner of the appliance's face. It's a bit awkward to squat and lean way over or else get on your hands and knees. This isn't that big of a deal, since, typically, refrigerator/freezer controls are rarely adjusted, but having had back problems in the past, this floor-level placement of the dial is a picky little thing I noticed.  Con: It sits unevenly, so that required a piece of cardboard. Not something you want to have to do after spending a couple hundred bucks, but it's a tolerable, easy fix.  Con: The basket is nice, but it would have been nice if the unit had come with two or even three, so as to make use of all cubic feet without simply stacking everything 4' deep.  How can we still give it 3 stars after so many cons? Well, first off, that's a testament to how badly and how long we've needed extra freezer space, that we're able to look past so many flaws to finally have one AND for it to be in black, a color that, for some inexplicable reason, is very difficult to find in a chest freezer.  Pro: It got to temperature very quickly and has done a good job thus far.   Pro: Other reviews we've read say that although the manufacturer recommends defrosting twice a year, longtime owners have a need to do it only annually. At less than a week old, the walls of ours already had a very, very light dusting of frost, but we are hopeful that once a year will be right. Even at twice a year, provided we defrost right before a grocery run when we're lowest on food, it doesn't look like it'll be difficult, albeit a bit of an inconvenience compared to self-defrosting refrigerator/freezers (as far as we know, chest freezers don't self-defrost). We'll be able to transfer chest freezer items to the main freezer and then, to release all the defrosted water, use the (supposedly easy) water outlets at the bottom of the chest (by opening both the plug inside the chest as well as the one outside the wall closest to the inside evacuation opening).  Pro: It desperately needed to be wiped down inside and out, which lifted a strange layer of something that turned damp paper towels dark gray, as though we had scrubbed our stainless-steel sink with scouring powder, but other than a few aforementioned, minor scratches on the inner liner, it seems lined well.  Pro: The lid's seal and weather stripping seem intact and without leaks, so the lid closes quietly, smoothly and solidly.  Pro: The lid isn't too heavy and, best of all, seems to stay open on its own, even when you don't have it slung all the way open. This feature allows you to lean down into it for food without worrying the lid is going to fall down on your shoulders. It's nice to not have to hold it open or worry about its integrity.  Pro: There's a neat little shelf area to one side, so it's not just a big pit at the bottom.  Pro: The basket is handy and helps utilize more cubic feet. Thanks to Amazon, we were able to find a compatible basket: Haier RF-0300-29 Refrigerator Basket. Now we have three baskets to fully using all top-to-bottom space.",8/8/15,

Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,3,4,N,N,Terrible Ice Maker,I have owned this fridge for two years now and continual wrestle with the ice maker.  Ice makers have existed for over 30 years but Samsung appears to have figured they should do their own bad design.  It does not make enough ice for a family of 4 at dinner time.  It freezes up regulary and if you turn it off to go on vacation turning it on from the panel does not work.  You have to reset it.  The refrigerator function works fine but I probably will not buy another Samsung because there are considerably cheaper refrigerators out there that refrigerate as well and have ice makers that have endured years of service.  Update: Icemaker finally quit making ice.  At least this ends the need for running a blow dryer every 3 weeks to stop the ice dams.  This is my first and last Samsung appliance ever.   Before you buy a Samsung fridge go look at reviews on the amount of noise they make and ice maker issues as they both appear to be common concerns with this product.,8/8/15,NEGATIVE

It looks great, but ever since we had it installed, we've had trouble with the lights. For the first year, we had to be extremely vigilant about the lights, since if we left them on for more than an hour or so, they would start to flicker, and when you try to turn them off the control panel was unresponsive, so we would have to turn off the breaker to the entire kitchen to reset the computer so it could turn off and stop flickering and making this annoying clicking sound. It's gotten worse and worse and now, only about 13 months after having it installed, the control panel started going berserk when we tried to turn the lights on or turn the fan on, and now the fan doesn't turn on at all, and the lights turn off immediately after turning them on (when they turn on at all). The company has been responsive and has now sent us a new control panel and circuit board, but we are now looking at likely a couple hundred dollars to pay someone to install them unless my husband is able to figure out how to do it. The instructions look fairly simple for the replacements of the actual parts, but according to the instructions, the whole unit must be taken down, which is what will probably require a repair man.

No issues at all.  It fired up, lit up, and chilled down in less than 2 hours.  This process could not have been easier in my opinion.<br /><br />last note - It has an anti fingerprint coating that isn't so anti fingerprint.  Oh well.<br /><br />On the whole, I am truly enjoying this upgrade in the kitchen and look forward to years of use.  At least I will be once I figure out how to organize everything in the right places...",8/7/15,POSITIVE

The first one to be delivered had to be picked up and replaced with a new one because the first was damaged in delivery. The men delivering the fridge were friendly, but they could use some training in proper delivery of items.<br />The fridge itself is great so far except for one issue: it makes popping/cracking noises once in a while. Not often, and usually at night (so I'm guessing this has something to do with the defrost?). It is right outside our bedroom in the kitchen and we can barely hear it, so I doubt it would bother anyone if theirs is placed even further away or on another floor of the house entirely. The only time it ever was a problem was when I was completely exhausted, ready for bed, and I had forgot to close the bedroom door. Just as soon as I was falling into my well-deserved peaceful sleep, the fridge popped louder than it ever has and woke me up. That being said, do NOT buy this fridge if you live in a studio apartment lol!<br />It looks great, does a great job at properly cooling and freezing. Love the filtered water icemaker! All the space inside and the LED lighting make this a perfect fridge for us, despite the once-in-a-while pop sounds.<br />I hope that it lasts as long as the Kitchenaide fridge that came with the house. The Kitchenaide was the only fridge this house ever had in it (20 years old house), and finally just died completely one day. Kitchenaide had very reliable, well-working appliances in its day, and I suggested to the spouse that we just have a repairman look at it and possibly fix it, but he insisted we should just get a more updated fridge that looks more modern.<br />Hopefully this one is good, if not better.

Water flow is slightly slowed for large filling because of the puncture spout interior diameter and the lack of the flow characteristics engineered into the Elkay products, but it works ok.",8/7/15,POSITIVE

The dryer vent is within the porch area so we've always had to deal with the hot wet air and lint. We had our house re-sided last fall and as part of the project an extension from the dryer vent was added (with a nice cover) so that it now exits the porch solving our past problems. The dryer vent extension extends straight down the exterior house wall and then makes a 90 degree turn and runs along the porch floor about 9 feet and exits the porch via a vent cover with a cover flap to keep the critters and bugs out when not in use.<br /><br />I needed a dryer duct brush to clean this new arrangement. It had to be flexible so I could clean the entire duct work from both ends. This product seemed like the perfect solution. I was very disappointed with the results.<br /><br />I actually read the directions and heeded the warning if the brush was going to be used with a drill  to ensure that none of the sections that screw on to each other came apart due to use of a drill. The first, and only time I used it the last two sections of the brush with the brush head came off and was now somewhere in the dryer ductwork.<br /><br />Now I was stuck with a duct brush in my dryer vent and had to figure out how to get it out. Using a long broom handle and a hook I screwed into the end of the handle I was able to grab it and pull it close enough to pull out.<br /><br />I won't ever be using this dryer brush arrangement with a drill again, it will be by hand if I ever use it at all. I ended up buying another type of duct brush attached to 10 feet  of flexible twisted wire coated in plastic. I'll most likely use that in the future to clean the duct from both ends of the duct work.<br />So, if you're gonna buy this brush, beware before you think about using a drill.

So, I hope this review helps anyone looking for an 18 bottle wine fridge. First of all, this is an 18 bottle wine fridge. It is not a wine fridge that states its 18 bottles and fits 14. With a little rack manipulation you can easily fit 18 bottles. I have champagne in there, pinot noir in there and cabernets. I've seen reviews saying that fancier thick glassed bottles don't fit into some fridges. I belong to a very expensive wine club located in Napa Valley. I am sure for the cost I am paying for those bottles their glass is quite good. Like I said, no issues making it fit. Just make sure you do some mixing and matching. As for function, this baby is very quiet. I have no put a thermometer in the fridge because I set the temp, and gave it a lot of clearance on each side. Side note: the manual says its ok for built in requiring 3&#34; of space. Online it says it is not made for built in and it needs 5 &#34; of space. I went with a free standing, 5&#34; clearance to be safe and every time I pull a bottle out it is nicely chilled. The racks are constructed well, and the stainless steel looks great. I love this fridge. Make sure you keep the fridge upright in the place you intend it to be for a day or so before you turn it on. I also recommend reading and following any instructions in the manual. Finally, if you are still skeptical...do what I did. Buy the protection plan for 12.60. Its worth it for something that I keep 100's of dollars worth of wine in. I hope this finds you well and good luck on your search.<br /><br />Andrew",8/6/15,POSITIVE

3171,US,37778854,R354KU62OT54C4,B00AW04ZMM,962476921,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine 7.9-15lbs with Spin Cycle ‚Ä¶,Major Appliances,4,6,6,N,Y,Little Washer Is A Winner,"Background:  Single guy living in 1960's condo with no washer/dryer hookups.  Laundry in the basement (3 toploaders, 3 dryers, 36 unit building).<br />I got tired of having to tapdance around other people and have had some clothes ruined with bleach stains from communal washers. Got tired of going up and down the elevator and setting timers for wash and dry cycles.  Got tired of large folding chore from letting laundry pile up.<br /><br />So I gave this a shot.  This definitely cleans clothes well, and quickly.  My 'light' loads wash for 4-5 minutes and my heavier jeans and towels, I wash for about 5-7 minutes; I rinse for about 3 minutes; then spin for 2-3 minutes.  At an average of 10-15 minutes per load, it is easy to get through a week's worth of laundry while doing other activities.  TIP:  I fill this with a bucket rather than the included hose.  The hose works well. but it does not fit on my sink faucet.  You can save LOTS of time by filling your bucket during each cycle.  So  fill your bucket, wash, and while washing, fill your bucket for rinse; while rinsing, fill your bucket for next load.  This REALLY speeds things up.<br /><br />I am not a country boy or a smelly single guy -- I am not a metro, but my Mom, so many years ago, was a clean freak.  Clothing isn't clean to me if it smells at all.  AT ALL.  It isn't clean unless the rinse water has the merest tinge of blue fabric softener, no brown or gray from dirt.  So, I am not one to reuse wash water, and I do not.  That said, a 5 minute wash REALLY gets clothes clean.  To each their own, but I am particular about clean clothes, and this machine does the job.<br /><br />Like most men, I overload washers constantly. You cannot overload this guy or the clothes will not spin to clean. Be patient, and remember that you are not sitting at a laundromat or a dank basement.  :)<br /><br />For a load, I use less than a tablespoon of Tide powder, less than a table spoon of fabric softener, and then add a bit more fabric softener in the Rinse, just a touch.  There are a few bubbles in the wash drain cycle and Rinse water is clean.  This is the correct amount to use. If your water is foamy like crazy, you're using too much product.  For lightly soiled items, you can load and wash.  For dirtier or thicker stuff, I let it soak in the soapy water for 5 or 10 minutes.  For whites that aren't so white, I have used OxyClean in a bucket, allowed my whites to soak for an hour, then wash them and they came out 'okay'.<br /><br />If you use bleach with this machine, make sure to RINSE TWICE.  This should get rid of enough of the bleach to keep subsequent loads safe from bleach stains.<br /><br />Clothes come out of the spin cycle more dry than they do out of a commercial washer, and I hang dry everything.<br /><br />I have done 6 loads and am still working out my &#34;system&#34; but filling buckets during wash and rinse cycles is really where its at.  It really speeds up the entire process, and I LOVE being able to work or watch TV or clean the kitchen or whatever while the wash is getting done.  The smaller loads encourage me to do a load or three whenever I have time, and the clothes are clean and fresh.  I own two drying racks in case I ever get behind, but so far, I've only needed one.<br /><br />My only concern is that even after the machine has run a full Drain cycle, there is still water in the bottom of the machine -- not the bottom of the tub -- the bottom of the machine.  I have yet to devise a solution for this.  So far, I have just picked the machine up , turned it upside down, etc.  This is not going to be a solution for many people who use this machine.  The concern here is that the rinse water, which should be pretty clean, is just hanging out in the dark recesses of the machine.  Storing the machine with the doors open is a good idea to avoid mildew.<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed that there is still water sloshing around in the machine?  How do you handle it?<br /><br/>All in all, for around $200 with shipping, the machine is good looking, well built, light, and allows condo and apartment dwellers and older folks who cannot go up and down stairs so well, as well as summer home/cabin by the lake dwellers, etc., to have a great wash option that is quick, easy, works great and is convenient.  It was worth the money to me.<br /><br />EDIT:  I am 6&#34; and a big guy and I can fit a fair of jeans and several shirts in one load. I can fit 2 regular towels and lots of kitchen and hand towels in one load.  I can fit maybe 5 pairs of boxers and 5 pairs of socks and a T shirt or two in one load. If you have oversized towels, or beach towels, you'll have to wash one at a time with one or two smaller items.<br /><br />You can wash slightly more than you can spin dry at a time -- but the spine drying LITERALLY takes between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.  For example, I washed a thermal hoodie, XL, with rubber liner (for extreme cold and wind), and several other items. When the wash and rinse was done, I put JUST the hoodie in the spinner and ran it for about 30 seconds, and it came out VERY dry.  Then, I spun the rest of the stuff for a minute or so.  The wash and rinse cycle is long, but even with a few seconds of spinning, the water is mostly out of the clothing.  Spinning longer is a waste of time and electricity.  That spinner is efficient.",8/6/15,

French Door Refrigerator,Major Appliances,3,1,1,N,N,Inside it is a great fridge; plenty of space for large trays of ...,"We've had this model for over a year. Inside it is a great fridge; plenty of space for large trays of food. Use of door space is well done. We often have large groups of people over for parties which is why we went with this model. We have not been disappointed with the space and love the middle drawer for produce and the clear glass in main compartment that lets you see into that drawer.<br /><br />The significant flaw is the thoroughly useless drain for water to flow into the evaporation pan. It clogs very easily and ice builds up on the bottom of the freezer - a huge sheet of it. After a week the water starts leaking out around the fridge. We remove the ice sheet and repeat the process over and over. I've cleaned the drain in the back but the issue persists. Other reviews say the same thing. The engineers of this potentially excellent product must have outsourced the creation of a drain to some shmo on the street.<br /><br />Ice Maker: Some reviews say the ice maker doesn't make enough ice to even fill up the glasses for meals. If you're the Waltons at Thanksgiving that would be a problem. Our summers are wretchedly hot and humid and the kids are hauling ice as fast as the thing can make it, but we have run out only on a couple of occasions. At least for a family of 5 the ice maker is just fine.<br /><br />I would recommend this refrigerator if the drain wasn't an issue.",8/6/15,POSITIVE

We've got a Whirlpool on order -- sure hope we're happier with that one.  Like other reviewers, we also noticed that the rack configuration on this Bosch is quite odd -- not horrible for a two-person household, but certainly awkward.  And the bottom rack consistently falls off the rails.  Maybe we're lucky, after all!",8/6/15,NEGATIVE

We were in the market for a mid-range dishwasher that would get the job done. I let my husband go to the appliance store alone, with a list of possible options (Whirlpool, Frigidaire... and one Bosch, since I had heard good things). This one was not on the list, but the saleslady must have done a good job convincing the DH because this is what we got.  I have hated it from the beginning.  Why do I hate it so?  Let me count the ways:<br /><br />1. The inside is VERY poorly designed!  The bottom of the top rack is not flat, so cups tip over during the cycle and fill with dirty water.  Gross.<br />2. The inside is VERY poorly designed!  The pegs on the bottom rack are spaced very strangely.  I cannot put two rows of dishes (small and large) next to each other because there isn't enough room.  They just don't fit!<br />3.  The inside is VERY poorly designed!  Some of the pegs are so close together that I don't feel the dishes get cleaned very well, so I have to space the dishes out more to get them cleaner.<br />4.  The inside is VERY poorly designed!  There is no good place to put the silverware holder.  If I put it along the side, I lose a row of pegs for dishes.  If I put it along the back, I lose a row of pegs for dishes.<br />5.  I can only fit one pot/pan on the bottom if I am washing dishes, too.  No matter how I try to rearrange the dishes, there just doesn't seem to be enough room to make things fit.<br />6.  I don't know if it's the poor design of the racks or if it is truly smaller on the inside, but this dishwasher washes much smaller loads than my last two dishwashers. I need to run it twice as many times as my old ones in order to do the same amount of dishes.<br />7. Because I am constantly washing smaller loads of dishes, this machine is costing me more $$$ in water and detergent!<br />8.  Since I can't get all the dishes from one meal to fit in a load, my sink is constantly filledwith more dirty dishes waiting for their turn to be washed.  Ugh.<br />9. I hate the buttons and the flashing lights!  If you don't actually press the on/off button before opening the dishwasher after running a load, the lights will blink... and blink... and blink... until you do.<br />10.  This dishwasher is the worst one I have ever owned!  I secretly hope it will break so I can toss it into the dumpster where it belongs and get myself a decent dishwasher!!!<br /><br />I cannot think of one positive thing to say about this dishwasher.  It really is terrible.  We are a family of four, not using a ton of dishes, and this thing is awful.  I would not recommend it to anyone!",8/6/15,NEGATIVE

We didn't have room for a normal dishwasher. We would have had to rebuild the cabinets to fit one in, so going with an on-the-counter option like this one was a very attractive idea.<br /><br />The hoses hook up easily. You connect the supply hose to your faucet, and you run the drain hose into your sink. They're attached in one unit, so it's easy to use. You can hook this up in a permanent fashion if you stick it in a cabinet and run the hoses to attachments on the wall. Just keep in mind that water won't flow uphill, so the drain line has to go downward. Several reviews complained about water standing in the unit, and I'm willing to bet that gravity is a contributing factor.<br /><br />After several years of use, we're remodeling our kitchen and going with a full-size washer. I'd definitely recommend this unit to someone in an apartment without a dishwasher or someone who, like us, didn't have the option to install a full-size.<br /><br />I'll mention also that we bought rectangular plates from IKEA that fit perfectly. 8&#34; round plates fit well.

Never experienced this before with my HE front load washer with the OEM rubber hoses. I'm assuming that the curve is just enough to restrict /change the water pressure a bit. There are solutions to eliminate the knock but, it would require adding a water hammer arrestor. Update 8-11-15 Changed out these steal hoses with new rubber hoses and the water hammer noise is gone. My theory is that the rubber hoses allow just enough expansion in the hose to accommodate the sudden shut off of water during the washer fill up?? There is also a curved connector on the female end of the rubber hoses I bought so, I no longer believe it might have been the curved connector that was causing the hammer issue as I mentioned in my first review. I researched a lot of water hammer arrestors (those that didn't require cutting the pipes and soldering to install) but, after speaking with a plumber, he commented that his experience with the arrestors that screw on was that they eventually fail and have to be replaced) These steel hoses are really well made but, the water hammer noise was really loud in the wall behind my washer when I was using the steel hoses and I was just too afraid of any future damage caused by the hammering. I've accepted that I'll have to be changing out the rubber hoses every couple of years to ease my worries about a water fill hose bursting from old age. BTW - my home was built in 1981 so, the water pipes inside my wall may not have been secured well to begin with.",8/5/15,MIXED

A Normal, Good Ole Washer With An Agitator!!","My daughter and I each purchased this washer after doing a lot of research. She is selling her 6 mo old Whirlpool Cabrio due to their household is on a well. She hates the Cabrio as she has to wash loads sometimes 2 or 3 times. Also, the water level is so low in the machine with no graduated water level option. The washer has just one extra choice....Deep Fill, but the agitation and spin with Deep Fill is too strong for hand washables. The Cabrio is working and I suppose for city folks it would be OK who don't have very dirty laundry. I'm aware of other people owning this machine having to add water. Currently I'm visiting my daughter so I have used the Cabrio. I'm in complete agreement with her...I hate that thing! I wasn't able to make any adjustments to suit my clothing as I'm very careful doing laundry. My clothing has a lot of embellishments and I don't purchase cheaper lingerie. I was at the ghastly machine's mercy! These HE machines brag about how much water they spin out, but just think about it, the stronger the spin the more wrinkles are set. Also, a strong spin is too hard for most clothing.<br />Her GE GTWN5650FWS has been delivered and what a difference! It has an agitator! Whoo Hoo! We also can adjust the water level, the spin speed,etc. She actually has enjoyed doing laundry again with a statement &#34;I love that washer!&#34;. Mine has not been delivered. I own a very expensive 6 yr old Whirlpool Duet frontloader set that is still working fine, but I've always disliked a machine &#34;thinking&#34; for me. The biggest gripe I have with that monster is if I make an error in choosing a cycle different from what I wanted....the stupid thing drains and spins in order to change cycles. There goes all my detergent, additives and water! What a waste! Also, that seven to ten year life cycle is fast approaching. My Sears tech says the struts are what goes and it's VERY expensive to repair. My salesman purchased his set about the same time I did. His broke downin less than 6 years. Would have cost him $1500.00 to repair! He was happy he had the extended warranty. So, I'm &#34;taking the bull by the horns&#34; so to speak, and disposing of it before the thing breaks down with a full load. The delivery guys can do with it what they wish as I still have the stabilizer bolts that came with it when delivered. These front loaders should NOT be moved without them. I've never liked the dryer either as it tangles and &#34;ropes&#34; clothes worse than any dryer I've had (7 of 'em). Moved a lot and the new owners always wanted the appliances. This will be the first time in over 30 yrs I won't have a matching set. I purchased the GE Right Height with Detangle Assist. Dryer drum has reverse action tumble...no more clothes in a huge ball, wet in the center and my husband's shirt sleeves roped so tight I had to rewash them! I plan on donating the dryer to our local animal shelter or Salvation Army as a dryer is fairly easy to move. Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it! Can't wait for the newbies! I'm going to enjoy doing laundry again. As an after thought, I am going to miss the washer's Extended Tumble option after the cycle is finished as it did help prevent wrinkles from setting. Always had it on my dryers, but it really is a nice feature on the washers, also.",8/5/15,POSITIVE

It was delivered in January 2013 and all was well. However, the freezer went out in late April 2015. Approximately May 15th we contacted the company (Haier) and they told us to contact a local repair person and they gave us name and number. They also told me that parts are covered under warranty but labor is not - so be aware of that possible cost. We called the local repair company and made an appointment for June 5 (~three weeks) to come and check the freezer. The appointment was confirmed by the repair company the day before. On the day of the appointment, we received a call saying they had gone out of business. We again contacted the parent company (Haier) on June 8 and were given the name of a different repair company. We contacted the second repair company and an appointment was made for Jul 3 (~two weeks). The repair person came that day but could not contact the parent company to confirm if the freezer was covered. I figured the entire point of having trusted repair companies was that they would know the warranty but apparently not. They said we would be called on July 6. We received a call two weeks later stating a new compressor was ordered and they would call us when it came in. About 10 days later they called and came to install the compressor on July 28. The freezer was cooling. My Mom did notice the suction was not the same as before but attributed it to the freezer not reaching the correct temperature yet. On Aug 1 she put frozen food in the freezer. Several hours later everything had thawed. By the morning of Aug 2, the inside temperature was hot and she unplugged the freezer. So nearly 3 months after we initially contacted the company my Mom still has a broken freezer and we get to play this game again. I wouldn't recommend this freezer or this company to anyone.",8/5/15,NEGATIVE

The only issue I had was with the faucet adapter, but I finally figured it out. I had to remove one of the rubber seals and then screw the adapter to the faucet. The white ring moves up and down, so you can leave the adapter on the faucet if you want, and just re-attach the hose via movable white ring when you use the machine. I'm sure I'm not explaining it well, and the only reason I figured it out is because we had an attachment like that on our portable dishwasher when I was a kid. I'm adding a photo so you can see what the sink adapter looks like once you get it apart. When you open the box, this adapter is inside the white ring on the water hose, so screw it on like normal, and then pull down on the white ring, and voila! The adapter stays on. Keep in mind, the adapter doesn't have a filter, so don't run the water full blast or it gets a little splashy when you're doing dishes or refilling the Brita. The machine is pretty quiet, so it shouldn't bother apartment neighbors much. The spin is amazing, so my clothes dry well on a drying rack or hangers.

We have had other GE appliances in the past, and have found them to be reliable, quality products. But we cannot say the same for this cooktop. By the second time we used it to cook dinner, two of the knobs had broken. These knobs control the gas to the burners. They are stainless steel handles with a thin plastic stem that engages the control valve. The stems split, allowing the knobs to turn without turning the valve stem. On one occasion this made it difficult to tell if the gas had been shut off, while on another we were unable to shut off the flame.¬†<br /><br />Because the knobs break easily and can turn without operating the gas control valve, the gas could potentially be left on. We are also worried that there could be more instances of the flame being unable to be shut off at the cooktop. Both of these situations could lead to serious injury. A search of the internet leads us to believe that this problem has happened many times previously, and that GE has been made aware of the problem some time ago. Why has it not been fixed? We expected better from the GE reputation and from our past experiences, and are sorely disappointed. We plan to contact GE Customer Service to see if there is any remedy.¬†We have also reported the problem to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",8/5/15,NEGATIVE

Maybe like 5 pieces of light weight clothing and a few socks or underwear thrown it. When you switch a full washer load to the spinner it take 2 separate spin load to do the one wash load in spinner. If you do long jeans its only gonna take like 2 pairs of adult size. Forget even attempting towels unless your desperate and have small towels. in tat case you can do maybe 2 lightweight bath towels tops. They just get to darn heavy loaded with water. Use a TEASPOON of LOW sudsing HE detergent TOPS , no more. Anymore and you will do like 3 rinses and possibly more depending on how much soap. Seems crazy but its true. Even one teaspoon of regular detergent will suds you up like crazy if all you have is regular I would do like half a teaspoon. Things like bras  or delicates need to go in a mesh bag first or you will have a twisted ripped mess .  DON't trust the hoses on your sink faucet end. Yeah yeah yeah they might hold one time and not the next... just hold it at the faucet end while filling , it only takes like 2 minutes. If you can use this IN the bathtub all will be golden. No worry about spills or mishaps or hoses slipping. have a hand held shower head and your REALLY golden for easy filling. DON't forget to get something like a rubbermaid tote lid to elevated bottom a bit from bottom of tub to avoid over soaking base too much. HUGE TIP..... if you use soap correctly and don't over soap... you can EASILY just do your rinse in the spinner. Just switch your water hose to the spinner side and run water in the first part of your spin cycle then drain for the rest of your spin cycle. This saves the whole step of having to do the whole rinse do-over after washing in the washing side. This step only works formostly  NON HEAVY items and not over suds stuff. Last but not least...Are you short on SPACE or storage? Keep this thing on a porch or patio or balcony. Just keep covered in a large tote or  something  to keep elements out. You can even RUN IT outside if you use a bucket to fill the wash side and use a big bucket for the drain when draining. I found a big Rubbermaid cooler works great if you have one of those anyway. So all that said... YES its somewhat a pain but YES does the job if you need it and figure out your best plan of attack with trial and error. GREAT for doing even your lightweight stuff at home to save moneyf and then saving your heavy stuff for the  laundromat. IT REALLY DOES WASH AND SPIN WELL...if used correctly.",8/4/15,POSITIVE

Stainless Steel Over-the-Range Microwave - Convection,Major Appliances,5,10,10,N,N,Top of the line :),"We've had this unit for over a year. It has taken awhile to appreciate all that it is capable of and we are still learning. The included programming is super, but you can and will need to work with it to get everything right or at least to your taste. I do wish the racks used for baking were sturdier; they will bend to scary points when you load them with large casserole dishes. The cooking, however, is grand. If you have downsized from a full-feature kitchen with wall ovens and all that - this might relieve a bit of your grief. If you are planning on self-install, it is VERY heavy and will likely take 3 people to manage that (or a magician) - two to lift it into place and a third to set the bolts above it.<br /><br />Bottom line - this isn't just a microwave, it is a smaller multipurpose oven that can often eliminate the need of using your larger oven in the range under it. It won't do a 20lb turkey, but 10-11 will work, so most of your lower back-ailing work can be shifted up top for the bulk of your oven deeds.",8/4/15,POSITIVE

Since I have had this wonderful machine for the past year, I have been able to keep up with all the laundry, and still enjoy my life!<br /><br />One secret to using this that I learned is to turn off the water after the wash water has all flowed in; that way, if you want to put in fabric softener, but you don't want to hang out over the machine, it will make a beeping sound when it needs more water for the rinse cycle and will not continue until you turn the water back on! Otherwise, you can time about 15 minutes for the wash cycle, keep the water on, and hope you don't get involved in anything more important.<br /><br />Another tip: I hang my clothes to dry, and I have discovered that it is helpful for faster drying to spin dry the clothes twice.<br /><br />Yet another tip: TURN OFF THE FREAKING WATER BEFORE YOU REMOVE THE WATER HOSE FROM THE SINK SPOUT. Yeah, we have learned the hard way. Make sure to turn it off and NOT remove the hose for a little bit, then place a towel over the connection as you remove it if you really don't want to take a shower at that moment.<br /><br />And, finally, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE DRAIN HOSE IN THE SINK AND FIRMLY DOWN THE DRAIN PIPE. Unless, of course, you want to wash your floors that day.<br /><br />I LOVE this washer and am very pleased with my purchase. It has improved the quality of my life considerably!",8/4/15,POSITIVE

He was told to do the work. when he went to pull the washer from the wall he said to me oh you need to take this washer out of the pan you have it in. I looked at him like he was crazy so me and my 18 month old daughter was supposed to take this washer out of the pan really? I said I can't take the washer out! Than he said will I can't work on it because is may crack. I told him to crack the pan I didn't care just fix the washer. He refused and left my house. So let me get this straight I miss several hours of work, I had to deal with a rude service person and my washer is still broken!<br /><br />I called Samsung and told them what happened and all they did was set me up with another service provider.

The color doesn't come off on other clothes so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />TIPS:<br /> - Soak delicates in warm soapy water for 20 minutes before starting the machine<br /> - Every few weeks run a load with cold water and 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to clean the machine<br /> - One wash cycle, two rinse cycles is usually best<br /> - After the wash cycle and 1st rinse cycle, lightly wring out the clothes to get rid of excess soapy water<br /> - If clothes are still really soapy after rinsing or are really stiff after air drying , decrease the amount of soap you are using.

However, the door, when opened, does take up more kitchen space effectively dictating where I located my small island.  With my new Bosch, I can load all my dishes, pans, pots, sheets without worry because the bottom rack has plenty of clearance space now.  If I were to consider a drawer in the future, it would be located in an outdoor kitchen or in a pantry outside a formal dining room as a supplement to the &#34;doored&#34; dishwasher in the kitchen and it would not be a Fisher Paykel but another brand.",8/3/15,POSITIVE

Capacity, in White",Major Appliances,5,26,29,N,N,The best washer made.,"We needed to replace our Maytag washer and dryer of 37 years (still running, but a bit noisy).  Of course Maytag is now cheap junk and we never would consider purchasing it in it's current form.  Did a lot of research and finally settled on Speed Queen because of their extraordinary quality. Not just the outer appearance, but because of the top grade components used throughout. (How many other washers offer a lifetime warranty on the inner and out tub)?  I was against front loaders because of all the problems that others are having, (mold, will not unlock with done, more service required, lack of being able to service properly and get manufacture to honor warranty, not washing clothes properly requiring two or more re-washes, etc., etc. etc.).  Wife chose another top loader as we are getting older and she doesn't like bending over. One excellent selling feature was she was able to reach to the bottom of the tub while standing flat-footed on the floor (she's 5'-4&#34;). Many other top-loaded brands needed a step stool to reach the bottom of the tub, something to seriously consider before you buy.  Nice large agitator which turns 210¬∞. (Some we looked at had a tiny, little nub which they called an &#34;agitator&#34;. Don't make me laugh, they couldn't wash a dish rag properly.)  Interior and exterior basket is made from high quality stainless steel. (Way to tell if it's high quality stainless (308, 316 grade) is to take a fridge magnet along and test it. A magnet will NOT stick to high quality stainless, it WILL stick to low quality stainless.)  Has a three year warranty on complete washer. (Some we looked at have only a 90 day warranty. Three months! What a joke. If the manufacturer doesn't believe in their product, why should I be expected to)? Five years on cabinet steel, motor and fifteen years on transmission. Inner and out tubs carry a lifetime warranty.  &#60;And it's made in America&#62;  We bought from a local dealer as we wanted to have a local service agent available should it require service, and for proper installation. However, if your modestly inclined, you shouldn't have any problems installing. Remember it weighs a couple of hundred pounds before you order.  Overall she loves it. Everything about it. It's quiet, works perfectly, cleans well and fast. I've never used it, but like its simplicity and quality of materials. No negatives whatsoever. We expect it to well out live both of us.

This is a tiny can sized USB powered can cooler/warmer. This is NOT an actual refrigerator. This cool looking device is a thermoelectric cooler. There is no compressor , no refrigerant, and no insulation. In other words, you can't expect this to give you an ice cold soda like a real refrigerator because it wasn't built to do that.  This will not MAKE your soda cold. . . it's not supposed to.<br /><br />So what is this device good for?  It's great for keeping an already cold soda or drink cooler a little longer. If you remove a cold soda from your refrigerator and put it in this mini fridge at your desk it won't get warm as fast.  It will still eventually warm to room temperature, just a little more slowly thanks to the cooling effect at the bottom of the can.  If you put a warm/room temperature soda in this and wait hours, you'll still have a warm/slightly less warm soda.<br /><br />How do I use it?<br />The aluminum bottom plate gets either hot or cold depending on what you have the switch set at. (Flip it one way and it cools.  Flip the switch the other way and it heats up.  Leave the switch in the middle position and the device stays powered off.<br /><br />For the cooling setting I like to put already cold sodas, drinks, fruits, fruitsnacks, candy bars etc. in this to keep them just a bit cooler longer. Of course I realize this isn't an actual refrigerator so I don't expect it to cool.<br /><br />If I have coffee in a small styrofoam cup the hot setting is great for slowing down the rate at which it cools to room temperature.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br />I was actually surprised at how cold and hot the aluminum plate gets to the touch.  I put a digital cooking thermometer probe on the baseplate and ran the device on both hot and cold for about 30 minutes to record temperatures.  In a room well above 75 degrees Fahrenheit the aluminum plate cooled to 25 to 30 degrees below the room temp.  I saw temperatures as low 40 some degrees which was pretty surprising.  I was also surprised at how hot the plate gets. I saw temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit and I was surprised because the plate gets almost to the point where it is too hot to put your hand on. Fortunately it stops just short of being so hot it's dangerous.<br /><br />Unfortunately these temperatures lead to false hope. These things are terribly inefficient and as cold or hot as the plate feels, it doesn't affect more than the bottom half inch or inc of the can or container.<br /><br />This is a great novelty item that works about as well as you should expect a USB powered cooler/warmer to work.  In my opinion if you pay $20 or less and like a fun novelty item for your desk go for it!  This will moderately slow down how fast your beverage cools or warms but don't expect miracles from a plastic toy made in China!um plate cooled to 25 to 30 degrees below the room temp.  I saw temperatures as low 40 some degrees which was pretty surprising.  I was also surprised at how hot the plate gets.

Also want to add that when using the Windex Crystal Rain, after cleaning the top with it, there IS a bit of a film.  But, rubbing the top with a dry section of the paper towel or a tea towel immediately removes that &#34;residue&#34; and it's like shiny, black glass again.  Seeing the minute splatter of anything (I'm a bit OCD, can you tell?, lol) across the top when doing ANY cooking just reminds me of how much splatter any cooking produced on my previous, traditional gas cooktop that I didn't even notice before.  You have NO idea how dirty your current cooktop or stove top IS until you see what happens when you just fry an egg or some such little thing on this - OY! - had no idea how much food splatters across the top.  I so love the easiness of cleaning this.  In seconds, I'm DONE!!!<br /><br />Update after 13 mos. of use:  Still VERY happy with no complaints.  The speed when bringing liquids to a boil, the evenness of the co",8/2/15,

This is located directly behind the bottom front panel, remove the 3 star headed screws at the very bottom to remove this panel and access the pump & it's clean out.  Get a shallow tray to catch about 3-4 cups of water when you unscrew the front clean out tray.  I found it the least messy to remove the front screw & back to rubber grommets holding the pump down.  Lift up the pump, put a towel under & tray to catch the water then unscrew the large front catch tray to drain water.  Disconnect the power clip by flipping up the cover on the end of the motor (right side).  Use channel lock's to pinch the clips holding the two hoses & slide the hoses off.  Installation is the reverse process.  It's also a good time to check the hoses for any stray items such as coins, hair pins, toys, etc.<br /><br />DESIGN PROBLEM:<br />As others have noted with this replacement item the smaller exit tube is off by approximately 70 degrees to exit almost directly vertical, vs the factory item which is about 30 degrees from horizontal.  Since I couldn't twist the existing hose which attaches to this exit tube, I needed a fix to this problem to use this new item.<br /><br />THE FIX:  Basically, the fix is to use the old housing with the new motor.  To do this, I removed the 3 screws holding the electrical pump with impeller (grey), to the plastic pump housing (cream colored), which the inlet & exit hoses attach to.  (Don't forget to takea couple photos of the original pump before disassembly, for reference) Then gently separate the two by hand, note there is a gasket to prevent leakage between these two pieces so they come apart easily.  Do this for the new & old pump so you can install the OLD cream plastic housing to the NEW pump electric motor.  Use the screws from the original unit with the new pump & be careful to install the electric pump motor at the same rotational degree to the cream housing as originally built, also being careful with the gasket.  Don't over tighten the screws, it's plastic!  Now, with the new electrical pump with impeller is attached to the original cream housing (with clean out tray) install the hoses & finish all installation.  Perform a test load or rinse & spin cycle to make sure there aren't leaks.  Reinstall the front panel to finish.<br /><br />MORE NOISE:<br />After installation I did notice an increase in noise but nothing too dramatic, so I can live with this as our washer & dryer are in a separate mud room.  If your worried about the noise or the FIX described, get the factory original unit.  Over half of the total pump install time was spent doing this fix alone.<br /><br />SHIPPING:<br />Since the pump wasn't eligible for prime shipping and expedited shipping was over $15, I ordered it with the standard free shipping.  To my surprise it arrived in only a couple days to Montana.  Very impressive since well over half the time my Prime 2 day shipping is 3-5 days instead of the guaranteed 2.<br /><br />RATING:<br />Rating given is reflective of; 1) not being a simple plug & play replacement, 2) great shipping speed, and 3) product functionality.  If the pump performs well over time, the rating may go up.  Purchase price was approximately $56 a week ago.",8/2/15,POSITIVE

I currently live with extended family so my beloved Speed Queen is in storage. Which means that for now I am using my family's top rated new Whirlpool Duet HE washing machine. Let me say there is no comparison. The Speed Queen is a far better machine than the Whirlpool Duet. I work on a dairy farm, so I come home with the dirtiest, stinkiest clothes.  Farm clothes are a true test for any washing machine. The Whirlpool Duet HE machine has a hard time getting the manure off my clothes, even on the heaviest cycle. With the Whirlpool, I can still pick cow poop off my shirt sleeves after they are &#34;washed&#34;. Gross! Plus, the Whirlpool Duet takes forever, and the clothes often have to be rewashed. However, my Speed Queen could get the manure off my farm clothes the FIRST TIME! No stuck on manure. Just clean. Plus, the Speed Queen is very time efficient. I could get all my clothes washed in a matter of a few hours. This meant my laundry was done, and I could spend the rest of my day doing things other than laundry. The HE machines are so slow it takes all day to wash the same amount of clothes. I highly recommend a Speed Queen. It is a simple, straight forward washing machine. It does a great job.

There appears to be quality issues with this model. The first one delivered had a defective door hinge that we detected just prior to installation. The helpful delivery people came back to pick it up and drop off a replacement machine. Shortly after they left we discovered the second machine had some broken stems which connect the plastic tub to the frame. We called and a few days later a third machine was delivered. At this point everyone including the delivery people decided to really give this third machine a close inspection. Sure enough, yet another defect was found. Some of the insulation on the junction box wires connected to the power cord was damaged, exposing bare copper wire. Left undetected, such a defect might have caused a  dangerous short circuit.  The problem could easily have been fixed by us with some heat shrink tubing. However the delivery people agreed that three defective machines in a row was indicative of a serious lack of quality control. The question raised in everyone's mind was what else could be wrong that cannot seen? What else could be broken but not revealed until after installation? Will this thing fail in a few weeks or soon after the end of warranty?  Reluctantly we decided to return this third machine and go for another model from a different manufacturer. We just ordered a Whirlpool WDF760SADB from Home Depot to be delivered next week. Hopefully it will be better quality.  In retrospect, we learned that the appliance division of GE was sold to AB Electrolux of Sweden for $3.3B in September 2014. In July 2015 the Justice Department sued in Federal Court to block the merger on grounds that the deal would hurt consumers. Morale at the GE appliance division must be terrible right now and the lawsuit just adds more uncertainty to their fate. The takeover, whether is happens or not, has most likely had a detrimental effect on quality control at the beleaguered appliance division. This consumer was adversely affected.  P.S. - We installed the Whirlpool on August 5 and it's running great. Also designed and made in the USA.",8/2/15,NEGATIVE

Stainless Steel Counter Depth Side-By-Side Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,2,5,6,N,N,I wish this fridge worked well because I really like it and it fits in my space,IMPORTANT UPDATE:  Finally a technician came and resolved the problem!!!  The problem was caused by water splashing over the pour spout that pours water into the ice maker. Ice was forming behind the back panel causing the motor to labor (noisy) and eventually fail or the fan to break.  The solution was to put a plastic tube around the spout to direct the flow of water. He was the only technician out of 4 to offer this simple solution and he said its a design flaw in the product. I hope this helps. its a great fridge again now.   Original post: I  wish this fridge worked well because I really like it and it fits in my space. I'm on my 4th service call for this refrigerator because water leaks or overflows inside the back panel of the freezer from the tube that dispenses the water to the ice maker. Either the motor or the fan has broken on a few occasions and it turns out that it's because of this water dripping down the back from the ice maker. I tried to adjust the water pressure in order to make the water slower but it still over flows from the filling tube that leads to the ice maker. The problem is that ice builds up on the back of the fridge very quickly and pieces of ice will fall into the motor area.  Most recently a piece of ice broke the fan and caused an error code and stopped the cooling. This appears to be a flaw in the design and I've only recently figured out what was happening because the technician took apart the entire back and showed me what was going on.  I really hope they can resolve this on the next visit because it's really not acceptable.  if anyone else has a similar problem please let me know how you resolved it.,8/2/15,NEGATIVE

I initially loved the look and functionality of my new fridge. Now 10 months old this is what I just experienced:<br /><br />My 10 month old french door refrigerator's fan starting making a loud noise. I looked up my problem on the internet and found that my unit has a know frost buildup issue. I called LG since it was still under warranty.  They diagnosed the unit over the phone and scheduled a service appointment for me. A new control panel was mailed out to me. The tech was supposed to be at my home between 8 am and noon yesterday. I received a phone call the night before confirming him for between 10 and noon. The tech did not show up until 1:05. He then proceeded to empty out my fridge, remove all of the shelves and the bins. The vent behind the veggie bin was encrusted with ice which he melted and chiseled away. Then the back panel inside was removed which revealed the entire coil frozen and encrusted with ice. It took until after 3 PM for him to melt all of the ice which resulted in my having towels both wet and dry all over the kitchen, a bucket for the excess water, not to mention my food, bins and shelves strewn about. The tech pulled out the fridge and replaced the control panel on the back. Then came the process of putting everything back together and putting all of the food back in. I then had to wash a load of towels and clean the fingerprints and streaks off of the stainless steel fridge. Well the first thing that I noticed was the once firm and solid bin holder now wobbles. But that is not the worse part, the worse part is that today, one day later, the fridge has begun to make the same sound and the ice is already forming around the vent. I was assured the the control panel (brain) would fix the problem. Well it seems to me that this is not the case and I know have to go through this again not knowing if the LG tech can figure out what actually is wrong. I called for another appointment and was told that as of now none is available for Monday or Tuesday so I have to call back on Monday to see when the next available appointment will be. Why should a new appliance have these issues? Why shouldn't an LG tech be able to diagnose and fix the problem on the first business? Why shouldn't I be able to get an immediate appointment for a return visit to rectify the problem? I'm regretting my decision to go with LG. I should have purchased a Samsung refrigerator. I own an LG Phone an LG smart TV and this refrigerator. I will never purchase another LG product again. Am I expected to miss another day of work to be available for service, suffer the mess and inconvenience of the repair process and then not know if after the second visit if it will be fixed or not?",8/1/15,NEGATIVE

A technician came out to fix our year-old refrigerator under warranty and proceeded to damage it beyond repair in the process. Now, LG will not provide us with a replacement. Here was our experience with them and their customer service.<br /><br />In March of 2014 we purchased a LFC25765ST French Door refrigerator. We received a great deal on the fridge at a price of $1,367. In July of 2015, the fridge suddenly stopped cooling. Below is a timeline of the ensuing events:<br /><br />7/14/15: Called LG to set up a repair appointment.<br />7/16/15: An official LG technician came to our house and determined three different components that could be the cause of the issue. He informed us he would replace the most likely component, and if that didn‚Äôt fix it to call him to come out and replace the second component. We needed to give the fridge at least 24 hours to cool.<br />7/18/15: The fridge remained broken, so we called and made another appointment for the technician to return.<br />7/21/15: The technician came out to our house and repaired the next component. He informed us that if the fridge still wasn‚Äôt repaired, that the issue must be the compressor, and he would return to replace it. Again, we needed to give the fridge at least 24 hours to see if it would cool.<br />7/24/15: The fridge remained broken, so we called and made a third appointment for the technician to come out.<br />7/28/15: The technician returned to replace the compressor, noting that this repair would certainly solve our issue, but early in the repair process, he snapped a loop component in the fridge and stated that that particular component could not be repaired, effectively bricking our fridge in the process. He asked for our original purchase receipt, which we promptly provided, and said he would send it in to LG so that we would receive a reimbursement or a new fridge.<br /><br />Keep in mind that my wife had to take time off of work for all three of these repairs in addition to our being without a working refrigerator for two weeks (and still going strong). In the end, LG has offered to provide us with a store credit at the location where we originally purchased the fridge, but for the original purchase price, not including tax or delivery, which together total an additional $200 in our original purchase. As this refrigerator was bought for an amazing--and now unavailable--deal after several days of research and shopping, even purchasing the exact same model would result in an additional expense of $500 at least.<br /><br />I called LG's escalation center stating that I didn't want a store credit. I simply wanted them to send us either the identical fridge or the current model of it. It absolutely sickens me that they would send an official technician into my home, who would then effectively break my property, and expect me to have any out of pocket costs, let alone over $700. Bear in mind that customers are required to use LG repairmen, otherwise, the warranty is voided. When I asked the escalation center representative how he would feel if I came into his house, broke his property, and only paid him for a portion of what it would cost to replace it, he said, ‚ÄúBut we paid you back for what you paid.‚Äù I said that I understood his viewpoint, but that an individual of his company destroyed my property and that an ethical solution should not cause any financial impact to me.<br /><br />Based on this customer service, I would never purchase any LG product again. I have worked in a similar industry and we would always either cover our customer's replacement costs in these situations or, ideally, provide them with a new, identical product at our expense. No one should ever incur any out of pocket costs when a corporation is at fault for destruction of property. Beware all LG products. Not only did this fridge last 16 months before needing repairs, thecompany that made it clearly doesn't value its customers or ethical business practices.",8/1/15,NEGATIVE

I tried both Seventh Generation and Trader Joe's powder detergent and they could never get the dishes clean compared toe Cascade etc. I'm not sure if the green formulations are just not effective for this dishwasher or they are generally ineffective but once I switched back to traditional powder detergent I had no problems. 2) Wipe the inside mesh base down with a wet towel.

POOR air circulation when filled up!!,"Any review that says this works GOOD out of the box hasn't done any testing! At least in a similar environment as I am in. I live in the desert with evaporative cooling. That means good luck keeping your cigar under 70 F in the summer. I've measured Temp and Humidity on all shelves simultaneously even at the bottom with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable calibrated devices. Although when empty temp and humidity are more constant. The purpose of the device is to fill it up with cigars and create a micro climate suitable for storage of cigars. If the humidor is full there is little to no circulation of air. Temp differences of up to 10 degrees F and humidity up to 20% from top to bottom when humidor is full.  Humidor needs air circulation even if it is satisfied temperature wise. There are no allowances for this. When the thermo electric devices is activated (transferring heat) it acts as a dehumidifier. This product was made with out any thought. It's just a thermo electric wine cooler with cedar shelves. Guess what? Wine is in a sealed bottle (It's own micro climate) cigars are not!!! You are supposed to be creating a micro climate for the cigars. I am currently modifying mine with extra fans an a controller (AC Infinity AI-ATC, Fan Thermostat and Speed Controller with two sets of AI-MPF80A2 Quiet Dual 80mm).

Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,4,4,N,N,Worst Refrigerator we ever owned,"We purchased a Whirlpool refrigerator, Model WRF560SEYM01, Serial #VS40591338 from Home Depot (Store 6364 W ST PETERBURG, 2070 TYRONE BLVD N, SAINT PETERSBURG, FL) on 07/04/2014, we did not take delivery until October 2014.<br /><br />The refrigerator was setup for delivery on September 20, 2014.  We made a trip from Melbourne, FL to St Petersburg the night before to accept delivery.  I called Home Depot at 7:30 am on September 20, 2014 to get an approximate time of delivery and at that time was informed that the refrigerator was on back order and could not get a date.  If I had not called we would have waited all day.  And we made a special three hour trip to be here after work at 10:30 pm the night before delivery!<br /><br />It was finally delivered over two weeks later.<br /><br />The two deliverymen did not take the packing out of the refrigerator and told us to leave the protective plastic wrap on the refrigerator, we had to call Home Depot to have someone else come out and do these things.<br /><br />On October 18, 2014 I called to get the water filter fixed, the filter popped out of the housing every time the water dispenser was used or the ice maker cycled.<br />The work was completed November 5, 2014.<br /><br />On 06/15/2015 we had to call because the refrigerator was making a very loud grinding noise.  At this time I had to fax a copy of my receipt, along with the model and serial number of my refrigerator.  At this time I learned that my refrigerator had been previously sold by Lowes.  This refrigerator had been previously sold to someone else!<br />Service was set up, and a part was ordered (Thermistor W10383615) and work was completed on 06/23/2015: ($274.70 in lost food and medicines.)<br /><br />The same problem occurred on 07/14/2015.  We were now out of the Whirlpool warrantee and had to schedule through our extended warrantee with Home Depot.  Service was set up and the serviceman came on 07/16/2015 and had to order a part.<br /><br />On 07/25/2015 the refrigerator shut-down due to ice build-up.  The serviceman told us this is the fourth of this model that he has worked on the same malfunction. The part was not replaced until 0727/2015; again we have sustained a loss of food and medicine. ($333.00 in lost food and medicine.)<br /><br />The serviceman requested that we let the refrigerator defrost naturally by leaving the doors open, which we did overnight.  When we turned the unit back on this morning (07/28/2015), the water filter leaked profusely when the water dispenser was used or the ice maker cycled.  I thought it might have been the filter.  I bought a new filter, installed it and it still leaked. Now I am out $50 for a filter I didn‚Äôt need.  We put in a request for a service on the filter unit, which was replaced when the refrigerator was brand new.  I am sure the service man will come on Thursday 07/30/1015 and will have to order a part and it will be another week that we will have to put up with a refrigerator that is not functioning proper.<br /><br />July 30, 2015<br />The serviceman was scheduled between 8:00-12:00 in the morning; he arrived at 2:00 pm because of his work load.  Not his fault and I really appreciate his service.  (He also told me this refrigerator is a ‚Äúpiece of junk‚Äù).  Both the water-line into and the water-line out of the filter were broken and mold was found inside the water filter casing (pointed out to me by the serviceman).  This serviceman had not previously touched the filter or unit. ( It had probably been broken by the person that serviced it in October of 2014.)  Oh, and he did have to order parts; so we are now without water or ice for at least a week?  Will I be reimbursed for the water and ice I have to purchase?<br /><br />July 30, 2015<br />After the serviceman left, I called the Home Depot Service Plan Hotline and they told me to take my complaint to the ‚ÄúStore Level‚Äù.  That will be my next step in this procedure.<br /><br />July 30, 2015<br />Two hours after the serviceman was here, we found a buildup of ice under the vegetable drawer.  The person I spoke to at the Home Depot Service Plan Hotline told me that I could not file a new service call because the previous one had not been closed yet.  This person was very curt and rude.",8/1/15,NEUTRAL

Because of the quality I'd seen in this dishwasher I set out in search of another Bosch (I ended up getting it from a local store) and I wasn't disappointed. There are clear improvements over my old dishwasher. For one this is even quieter than the old one was. If you don't know how to tell how quiet things are when listed in dbA there are some great charts online if you search. (FYI 44 dbA is very quiet, especially for a typically noisy appliance). If you have a noisy dishwasher now the attached image will give you an idea of how much of a change this is - that red light on the floor is there to tell you the dishwasher is running a cycle so you don't open it.<br /><br />The 3rd rack for utensils is very useful. It's an excellent place to stash those spatulas and other items, including extra flatware, making it great for multi-course dinners (or people like me who mess up way more than they should). It does take away a little real estate from the 2nd rack, but that one is adjustable so it is not a big deal. Have some extra-tall items in the bottom rack? Adjust it upward. Need more room in the second rack for tallish glassware? Adjust it downward. (see image) Another nice thing (and so many dishwashers don't seem to have it, I don't know why) is enough flatware compartments for you to sort as you load so you can grab like items easily to unload later. Between this and the 3rd shelf you can forget your sorting flatware and utensil headaches. One thing my previous Bosch had that I wish this one had is the easily convertible racks. You could easily angle and flatten various bits of the racks to accommodate your needs at the time. This one has parts that do that, but others that don't. Not a big deal though.<br /><br />Cleaning is also substantially improved over my old Bosch, which was a vast improvement over the 'dishwashers of yore' that involved washing the dishes before washing thedishes (or having a dog or two on call to 'pre-rinse'). The first job I had for my new dishwasher was a truly nasty one too. I had agreed to let someone come over and use my smoker for a pile of ribs before I discovered my previous dishwasher was dead (my smoker is the variety that allows you to shove all the internal bits into a dishwasher). Like anyone who has had a good dishwasher for a very long time my own washing skills are sorely lacking so all the 'smoker bits' were left to swelter. What I expected to be a day or two turned into several days of hot hot sun baking that stuff into the racks too. NASTY! The new dishwasher not only removed all that gunk, but restored the parts to an almost pristine condition (allowing for typical wear and tear). Awesome. I gave it a disgusting task right off the bat and it breezed right through.<br /><br />Next job was to re-wash all the things I had hand-washed earlier (did I mention my wonderful dishwashing skills?) just in case. Plus all the flatware because let's face it.. after a few days who knows which ones were my shoddy work vs. previously Bosched. Those I did on a short cycle because in theory they were clean (or they would have been if someone with better skills had washed them, I'm sure). Easy breezy. Spotlessly clean and now sanitized dishes ready to go back to their places.<br /><br />After a few days of eating take-out when I discovered how long it would be until I had another dishwasher (and how bad I was at washing dishes) I cooked a lovely dinner, so there is load #3. Filthy rotisserie bits, greasy pans and lots of dishes. This time on a normal cycle using the delay so it runs in the middle of the night. I love waking up to clean dishes I didn't have to wash, don't you?<br /><br />Overall this is a great dishwasher and well worth the cost. My old Bosch actually cost more in its day so the price is even more reasonable. It met expectations and even exceeded them in the nasty smoker bits category. Welcome to thefamily new Bosch... you and I are going to get along just fine!",7/31/15,POSITIVE

It stinks the whole house. It also does not dry dishes. And is only so-so at cleaning. Definitely not as good as the 10yr old whirlpool it replaced. The problem with this dishwasher is the door comes unlatched during mid cycle. It stinks up the house due to old stagnant water laying in unit. Problem is it pops open 10 times every cycle. It takes a couple of days to get a load completed. So I researched a little and found that Bosch has had problem with door latches for over 5 years! You can place one finger on the door and it pops open. Bosch sent a repairman out. He said they see this all the time. In fact he was leaving my house to go report another unit. He said Bosch answer is to replace the door latch, but barely does that fix the problem. He said he could remove the trim pieces on the side of machine that prevent you from looking between  unit and cabinets. He removed them and unit worked perfectly during the two weeks waiting on part (there is a huge demand for these parts). Serviceman came back installed the new latch and asked if I wanted him to install the trim strips. The machine is noticeably louder with the strips removed. I told hime to re-install them. Unit is almost the same as before. Now the door only opens 4 or 5 times a cycle, instead of 8 or 10. The trim strips I spoke about install between the door and the frame. They are too stiff and put pressure on the door. It amazes me that they have had this problem for 5 years<br />Bosch also told me that the unit was not installed correctly and if that was the case I would have to pay for service call. From reading the other review, this is a typical Bosch tactic. Blame everything on the installer.  I asked what could be wrong with the install to cause this but they could not answer. I will have them service this unit one more time. If it is not fixed, I will demand a refund. When they refuse, I will go to local courthouse and file a small claim. I may win or I may not win, but at least I will get the satisfaction of them having to pay a lawyer $200/hr to come and defend this in court. I have done this a couple of times before and the company (different companies) always relents. It is cheaper than paying a lawyer. Even if they don't you are only out $20.<br />It is a shame that the service person knows how to correct the problem, but Bosch won't listen to him. What a stupid arrogant company.

The temp display is on all the time and glows brightly at night in a dark room. The cooler holds nowhere near 120 bottles and even less if you have anything other than the skinniest of Bordeaux style bottles in your collection. We had to pull out a couple of shelves to make room for some large format and non-conventional bottles, like Turley or sparking wine. Eighty bottles is a realistic capacity for this cooler. Unless you want to sacrifice even more capacity, the bottles have to be placed on shelves parallel to the front of the cooler. If you pull out a shelf that is less than full, the bottles roll and clink crazily. Also, the lip at the back of the shelf is not adequate. If you aren‚Äôt careful, a bottle will roll right over the back and fall down to the next shelf. The shelves are not adjustable. The only way to increase clearance between two shelves is to remove a shelf. The unit had a very strong chemical odor, initially. Be prepared to air it out or load it with boxes of baking soda.

a water dispenser for many years and totally love it.  I'm quite experienced with what I want and don't want in a cooler.  I call them water coolers because their commonly known as around the office.  There are several things to note about them, but nothing particularly earthshaking or cautionary.  They are intuitive to work and very handy to have around.<br /><br />The Avalon came very well-packed, but because it has refrigerant it shouldn't be carried or laid on its side.  I had no problem pulling it up a few short steps by the plastic straps.  Don't remove them until you're in the approximate area you wish to set up the dispenser.  Once they are removed, the dispenser will be rather awkward to move.  I say this from experience because I did this on another large item and had a lot of problems moving it.<br /><br />It was easy to get it out of the box once I started.  I clipped the straps and then took a box cutter and slit one side.  The cardboard fell away and left me with the dispenser sitting on a Styrofoam base (there was one on the top as well).  After the removal of a few pieces of tape I was good to go.  If you're in a high traffic area or want to make sure it doesn't tip, there's a bracket that can be screwed into the floor (included).<br /><br />The best idea is to let the Avalon rest for at least a 24-hour period to let the refrigerant settle.  There are two switches on the reverse side that are clearly marked.  Make sure they are both on before starting.  If you aren't going to use the hot water for some time, simply keep it in the \\""Off\\"" position so it will enter a power-saving mode.  There's no storage area in this particular dispenser, something my other one had.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't go the cheap route, buy one bottle of water, and refill it from the tap.  These dispensers can really suffer from mineral deposit buildup that impact the performance of the machine.  I had my dispenser for years and use Primo water and never have had an issue.  It will take both the three and five gallon bottles.  The Avalon is a bit tall so I stood on a bench to install the bottle.  A full five gallon bottle is quite heavy and should be done by someone capable of lifting and balancing the weight.<br /><br />After I had everything set up, it didn't take very long for the Avalon to heat the water on one side and cool on the other.  I do love the fact that I only need to push the taps to get a cup of water.  With my other one I had to press a button and catch the stream of water below.  There's a great safety feature on the hot tap.  I do need to press the red button on the front as well as the tap.  This will prevent anyone getting scalded accidentally when getting some cold.  FYI, if you have children under the age of eight, I'd give this one a pass.<br /><br />The cold dispenser doesn't dispense ice cold water, but it is cold.  The hot dispenser is quite hot.  I tested it by putting a little packet of Swiss Miss in a mug and dispensed some hot.  The cocoa totally dissolved sans that hideous clumping I hate.  It was nice and hot, but not boiling.  There were no extremes in temperature, but that wasn't something I wanted nor expected.  One last hint is not to set it up in where the sun will hit it because my other one yellowed in time.  All in all, I do love the Avalon and would highly recommend it to someone who wants a sleek, efficient water dispenser.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.ever have had an issue.  It will take both the three and five gallon bottles.  The Avalon is a bit tall

hot dispenser is quite hot.  I tested it by putting a little packet of Swiss Miss in a mug and dispensed some hot.  The cocoa totally dissolved sans that hideous clumping I hate.  It was nice and hot, but not boiling.  There were no extremes in temperature, but that wasn't something I wanted nor expected.  One last hint is not to set it up in where the sun will hit it because my other one yellowed in time.  All in all, I do love the Avalon and would highly recommend it to someone who wants a sleek, efficient water dispenser.    Sample provided for review.",7/31/15,

Really a poor product for such a great name brand.,"I did not buy this on Amazon, however I have the exact same wine fridge and it is AWFUL! I have had it for 7 years (it was a wedding gift), however I have only been using it for about 5. It has always been in a temperature controlled room, and rarely moved other than for cleaning. For awhile now (not sure how long, but I caught it a few months ago...) it has not been able to cool at all, being stuck at 77 degrees. I contacted Cuisinart's customer service, and because it is more than 3 years old, they will not do anything about it. I have had to re-explain myself to many different customer service reps from Cuisinart, as my emails have been handed over from person to person. I have a lot of Cuisinart products and have never had such a horrible experience. I can't believe they don't guarantee their products for longer than 3 years, and I can't believe they are unwilling to do anything to help. They would not offer any suggestions as to how I could try fixing it, only telling me they would be willing to sell me a new one. I am so very disappointed.

Be careful not to touch the covers when trying to hold it up.<br /><br />3. You have to drill holes for installation in preset locations (mentioned by others too), but the locations don‚Äôt give you enough tolerance. I had one screw almost on my front cabinet. Other manufacturers making units one sixth the price have a slot where you put up screws and slide the unit on them. I had to use nuts and bolts, so I have holes in the inside of my upper cabinet. One person had to hold the unit up while another put in the bolts. The manufacturer should have several pre-drilled spots with the wider holes to slide on to screws to easily solve this.<br /><br />3. There‚Äôs a metal box near one of the screw locations making it difficult to work with with almost no room for your hand.<br /><br />4.

And then it started.  First, it was ice buildup in freezer. Then frost/ice built up on the evap coil located behind the wide deli drawer inside the refrigerator (yes there are two evaporators on this model).  The refrigerator stopped cooling although the wide deli drawer remained cold).  First service visit diagnosed a bad evap and ordered a new one along with a new compressor (&#34;because the life of the compressor has likely been shortened due to the bad evap&#34;). Second service visit was to install the evap and compressor - or so I thought.  This tech said we didn't need a compressor, just a new evap. Once he got into the unit he said only the evap fan was bad and that we needed a new fan, not a new evap. He ordered the fan because of course he didn't have one in his truck (&#34;we don't carry parts&#34; ). Third service visit - replaced fan, still no good, now need a control board replacement.  Installed board and checked the loud freezer fan which had ice buildup on it causing it to be loud.  24+ hours later, the unit is now quieter, but the refrigerator is holding steady at 54 degrees which is well over 15 degrees too warm!!  It has been over two weeks of living without a refrigerator.  We've been buying ice nightly for the ice chest that keeps a few essential items from spoiling.Whirlpool customer service is basically non-existent - it is merely an answering service.  HANDS DOWN THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ALL TIME.  That's saying a lot because I have Charter Communications cable TV!!  Don't but this refrigerator and find yourself writing a scathing review a few months down the road.  I wish I had heeded the warnings.

Ease of use is fantastic. It's quiet. The dispenser seems a bit backwards from what we were used to, but it's still good. I don't like how the decals for the ice and water are already coming off - not truly decals - they are printed on the product. I DO NOT appreciate the fact that we purchased this last October and had it replaced with the same model in March due to an internal frost issue. The inside back of the refrigerator behind the drawers and trays had an excessive amount of frost accumulate on it. Replacement product has been great until recently, when the same thing started to happen. Apparently LG knows about this issue and has re-worked the control board on the back side of the fridge that controls the defrost mechanism. Hopefully this will fix the issue...unless I have it replaced with the newer model, but apparently those boards are all bad as well. If you know about an issue, do a recall and service the items before customers have to go through the hassle of having to deal with them. Get on board with quality customer service, LG! On another note, be prepared to take the excess ice out of the ice-maker frequently - we have a container in the freezer for the excess ice. The ice maker bin is small, so it doesn't hold much and the shut off valve is non-existent in these models - a huge design flaw, but definitely not worth not owning this huge capacity refrigerator.

The feature that this has that the other cheaper products has is that it allows you to spin some of the water out of the clothes, so you don't have to wring quite as much  and they don't drip as much when you hang them to dry.<br /><br />However, the product is pretty cheaply made. I'm okay with the bucket just being a giant, cheap, plastic bucket (over sized salad spinner). Salad spinners for salad are usually pretty expensive, after all. But there is always black pieces coming out from where the handle comes out of the top. It's not a huge deal because it doesn't get into the clothes, but they are very hard to wipe away because of their location, and if you don't wipe them away the handle squeaks a ton while spinning.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm happy with this purchase. It definitely does get the clothes clean and it's nice to have an alternative to going to the laundromat for small loads.<br /><br />Here's my process for using it:<br />1. Fill up the tub a little over half way with water (so far I've only used cold) and put in a drop of soap. Mix the soap and water with my hand.<br />2. Move the bucket out of the tub onto a stool next to it, so that when I drain later, gravity will help.<br />3. Put in my clothes and let soak for a few minutes to an hour (whenever I remember to come back).<br />4. Turn on Pandora and spin (changing direction randomly) for the duration of one song (2-3 minutes)<br />5. Let drain. This takes a few minutes.<br />6. Fill it up again with cold water. Spin for another 2-3 minute song.<br />7. Let drain.<br />8. Once it's drained, leave valve open, hold onto the pod (it's much lighter without water in it, so flies all over the place if you're not careful), and spin for another minute.<br />9. Hang to dry completely in a room with tile floor and a fan. How wet the clothes still are after you spin depends on the fabric and how full the load is. Sometimes it still drips, but not always.",7/29/15,POSITIVE

This four small rotor agitator does not torque the water as well as the three rotor agitator. The bumps between the rotors prevent the water from getting between the rotors and spinning with a large torque. Not to mention the rotors themselves are very small and don't push the water. I sent it back, because putting only two of the same towels in it caused it to stop rotating much at all.

If you refill the machine to rinse, you can use up to 3 gallons of water&#34; [total, wash + rinse water]. &#34;You can also rinse by hand, and perhaps use less water.

Reason being, our Florida weather makes it difficult to fully control temperature in regular humidors short of keeping your thermostat at 70 all day...and that isn't going to happen. While I'm away, it is kept at 83'ish, so that is not a good scenario for cigars. So this unit became my choice so I could eliminate temp variables. Now, the good:<br />1) Nice looking unit...a bit deeper than I envisioned, but not a problem and holds plenty of cigars for someone not trying to show off with hundreds of them. I have maybe 50 in there, but will add more at some point.<br />2) Very quiet<br />3) Nice display...the LED light inside doesn't really do much with the drawer and shelves in though. You can see it, but it doesn't light it up like I know I would like.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Like I've seen in other reviews, the temp is NOT accurate. I've put 3 thermometers (digital hygrometer with temp., a maverick remote temp probe, and another) and they are ALWAYS reading 4-5 degrees higher than the unit display. This might be a problem if it is not properly controlling temperature as advertised.<br />2) I don't know if it's a learning curve or not, but I cannot get consistent humidity readings in different areas inside. I properly seasoned it and even kept it empty for over 4 days to get that right. The hygrometer that comes with it will read 62, the digital one will read 71, and another analogue one will read 80 (they have all been salt method calibrated!). So I ordered the Boveda 75 calibration pack and re-did all of them (minus the built in one). Same result...no consistent reading when placing them in multiple areas inside the unit. I'm using the Xikar crystal gel humidifiers (250 count) with PG solution. I started with the container and distilled water to season it, added in 1 Xikar with PG and let it sit for a few days. Once I saw a 66-70 humidity reading on thedigital, I put some sticks in. A day later I put the rest in. Expecting a slight drop in humidity from adding the sticks, I waited another day. Now the humidity was too high. I removed the container and left the 1 Xikar. Another day or so goes by...now it's too low. So I added another Xikar...now goes too high....@#$%^&*!!! Remove 1, and finally the digital goes to about 69. BUT...the other hygrometer on another shelf is reading....76...WTF???<br /><br />So, I'm not sure what to do with this unit at this point. I'll keep trying to balance it for awhile, but if I can't get it right, and that coupled with the temp inaccuracy, it will go back. I don't want to return it as it is a nice piece, but I need it to work. I may try the battery operated air freshener fan (without the freshener in it of course) to see if more air movement will equalize things.",7/29/15,NEGATIVE

I have a very large kitchen and we have two built-in dishwashers as we entertain frequently.  My other unit is a top of the line KitchenAid.  I no longer use the Samsung... my partner uses it.  If I hadn't paid so much for this thing, I would gladly rip it out and chuck it in the garbage.  I would not recommend it to anyone.",7/29/15,NEGATIVE

I'd say you lose a good 4&#34; of drawer depth from the reservoir... but the water dispenser is pretty awesome (more on that later).<br />- Has adjustable feet instead of adjustable rollers, that means when you adjust the feet it lifts the rollers off the ground. Pain in the butt if you need to pull the fridge out for some reason, not like you need to do this often but still a minus none the less.<br />- Lighting is not the best we had seen in our search for a fridge, All the other brands had lights all around to eliminate shadows and dead spots. This has two lights at the top which are blocked easily by eggs or pizza boxes.<br />- The left door is a bit harder to close than the right one since the door spacer is on that side. Which is a pain since the water dispenser is on that same side. If you open both doors at the same time it's not an issue. Wish the spacer was on the right side.<br /><br />Okay on to the things that I love about this fridge:<br />- It holds magnets! Love putting our kids artwork on the fridge and our GE profile fridge didn't allow for that.<br />- From the time we plugged in it was cooling groceries in 4 hours. This thing keeps food COLD, notably our lunch meat which has an extra three days of life (8 days total) over our last fridge.<br />- Ice! This thing cranks out ice like I've never seen before. 18 hours after I plugged it in we had a full bin of ice. It breezed through our last dinner party where most were drinking mixers. Love the ice maker, which btw comes with a built-in scoop holder and scoop and with the flip of lever it attaches to the door so it slides out upon opening.<br />- Water dispenser rocks. We used to buy bottled water since our tap water tastes so gross, not anymore. Water comes out cold and it tastes like deerpark water.<br />- It's a beautiful fridge and it fits like a glove in our cabinet cut-out.<br />- All the drawers open and close smoothly, including the freezer drawer and inner storage.<br /><br />If you add up it up appears that the negatives outweigh the positives but I don't think so. We went into this knowing that every fridge we considered would have it's drawbacks. I only found one negative review in my countless hours of research and that is worth peace of mind to me. It seemed that for every good review I found of another brand there was an equal amount of negative reviews. We are a family of four with a 5 and a 2 year old and it's plenty of space for us at the moment, we do have another fridge in the basement that holds a decent amount of frozen goods though. No regrets here I would buy this fridge again for sure.<br /><br /> As a side note this is the same fridge as the kitchen aid architect II series and another jen airr model. Tried finding the differences between them but I could not.",7/28/15,POSITIVE

Very quiet during cleaning and just a bit of noise once it discharges the water (noise coming from the water hitting the sink, but nothing major). You can watch TV or listen to radio while it operates with no trouble. - Enough capacity for our needs (a couple in a small apt) - No leaks - Chose this model over other models available on amazon because of the color.  I like the metal / grey finish.  CONS: - Relatively heavy: I was able to put up on the sink on my own but some people might need some help to unpack the unit and set it up on the counter.  Overall incredibly happy with the purchase.

Never less, the little Panda performed amazingly all that time.  Bought this machine about 5 month ago, brand new. It came nicely packed in one box, no signs of water residue or damage. Plugged in, filled with water and started to do laundry the same hour it arrived and has been using it more or less every other day ever since.  Reason to buy:  newborn in the family, which lives in a tiny apt. in Brooklyn with no room to fit a standard size machine.  Appearance: cheap plastic with no squeaks or sharp chips. Nothing rattles inside.  Capacity: I'm an XL size hog and able to fit 1 of my Levi's denim shirt and 2 office style shirts at the same time. Or 2 denim pants, or all the baby's laundry she manages to dispatch in a week.  Pluses: relatively quiet, though tends to get louder after a cycle or two. Action is VIOLENT, tossing poor laundry left and right, washing away even toughest chit. Self water emptying is a huge plus. Dryer is amazing, spinning things to near-dry condition. Require a likkle drop of detergent compared to a Hercules downstairs in the basement.  Minuses: LINT IS A HUGE PROBLEM. Ye be warned mates, if you have &#34;fluffy&#34; goods to wash, I assure you that the lint will get EVERYWHERE - into the sink (use the fine mesh to catch it), into every crevasses of your load, and I'm yet to find a way to reduce the effect. Buy some extra lint rollers, trust me you'll need them all and they tend to finish right at the wrong moments. Some recommended a laundry mesh, me skeptical yarr. Power cord is short to reach an outlet high up, like mine in the light fixture on top of the mirror, so I've got a $0.99 extension in the nearby store. Better use the High Efficiency Turbo detergent, regular one produces a lot of foam and require extra rinse. No wheels so you have to carry it around.  Resume: for the money it is absolutely amazing little machine which will save you time and money and will washup stuff just like it's &#34;bigger brothers&#34;, a must for a tiny living spaces.",7/27/15,POSITIVE

Realizing it was under warranty I contacted Whynter the manufacturer whom requested I send their services department pictures of the unit so they can try and blame me for not properly placing the unit in a well ventilated area. After I disagreed with their accusation (the unit was 6 inches away from any wall and free from all foreign objects) I was requested to disassemble the back of the unit and take more pictures. It was requested that I replace a fuse on the circuit board and determine if the heat syncs were hot (they were - ouch!). I was finally informed that they believe the unit needed a circuit board replaced and I had 2 options: I could ship the unit back to them for repair or I could have a repair technician come out and install it as it requires soldering. When I asked about reimbursement they offered a potential shipping discount at my expense (shipping the unit back at my expense would incur a cost of over $150) and they will only reimburse me up to $65 for the repair (though there‚Äôs not a repair service in my area that would even entertain sending a technician out for less than $100). I have unlimited resources to spend troubleshooting an inferior product so I scheduled to have a technician come out to install the replacement part. That did not fix the issue but guess what? Having the technician perform the repair services voided my warranty. Could you believe it? What a clever little loophole. So now I have a $500 piece of junk I can‚Äôt even throw away without incurring more cost. This company does not value their customers or stands by the quality of their product so please do yourself a favor and purchase a refrigerator from a manufacturer you can trust.,7/27/15,NEGATIVE

Probably OK if you live in Alaska and dont heat your house.,"An earlier model (WC-20SD) that I have had for 8 years and gave great service finally went dead so I bought this updated and much nicer looking replacement. The two units are identical in size and specs and are supposed to be able to cool 20 bottles of wine down to 54 degF assuming the ambient temperature is not more than 86 degF. ie. Specs state it can only drop the temperature by 32 degF. The earlier model had no problem cooling to 54 degF and did so as long as I had it. The new model, installed in the exact same under counter location with 5 inches of clearance all round, can only manage to cool to 57 degF. I have measured the surrounding temperature and it's barely 82 degF. The main difference I observe is that the older model had two 3 inch fans cooling the hot side of the heat sink, whereas the new model has one 4 inch. 12/2/2015 update. I've dropped it to one star from my original 3 star. When I bought it in July I was giving it the benefit of the doubt since my ambiant temperature was 82F.

The directions should also say do not dry heavy weight or large item, like jeans or shoes. Once I learned how to load the dryer correctly it worked quieter, I am super happy I bought the dryer.

After using the range for exactly three years the LCD display is starting to break.  We looked online and discovered it is a capacitor problem which will probably cost $200 to fix. Also, after the first time I used the self-cleaning feature of the oven, the blue paint started to blister from the heat.  Each time I use the self-cleaning feature more blue paint blisters so my oven constantly looks pitted and dirty.  Obviously, the pretty blue interior is just that, pretty until you use the self clean and then it turns ugly.  I would rather have the standard, durable grey interior.  Pretty does not rank over durable.  I wish this oven was designed better and was more durable.  I would not recommend it for anyone who is looking for a quality product.",7/26/15,POSITIVE

Besides making ice whenever you want, you can take it with you. It's great for a camper. I'm writing this review a full year after the purchase, and am now adding some comments since someone sent me a question about the machine. Yes, it does come with a scoop. Plus there is a nice plastic basket that catches the ice cubes. It's quick and efficient. You fill it with the water--you don't need a water source. I've been using bottled water because our tap water is from the well and has some calcium in it that could possibly accumulate on the mechanism and cause it not to work. I saw that a couple other people had complained that their unit quit working. I'm wondering if maybe they also have calcium in their water. Calcium builds up in faucets and pipes and is what caused the ice maker in our refrigerator to stop working. Rather than pay over $300 to fix the refrigerator's ice maker, we bought this one. We liked that we would be able to make it double for our camper as well as our house. This machine makes ice fairly quickly. NOBODY paid me to say these things. I bought it full price after researching several. Also, you can purchase an extended warranty on it if you want. We bought the extended warranty, but it doesn't look like we needed to. Over a year later, I'm very happy with this purchase. Plus the cool thing is if you Amazon Prime, the shipping's free.",7/26/15,POSITIVE

My older microwave's manuals and template were normal paper. My new one is not. GE is apparently trying to save money on paper. Why would you build a high quality microwave and then try to save money by using cheap paper? The manuals were a bit hard to read on this cheap paper but my main problem was attempting to tape the template that goes on the bottom of the cabinet you will be mounting the microwave under. The paper was so thin that the only part that stayed in place when you held it against the bottom of the cabinet was where you had your hand. The rest of it just collapses and hangs down making it very hard for one person to tape it. GE if you are going to go cheap on the paper at least put the templates on stiffer/thicker paper. Other than the paper complaint and instructions not being the easiest to understand the microwave itself is very nice and I have no problem recommending it.,7/26/15,NEGATIVE

NewAir charges exhorbitent prices for replacement parts.,"Year 2: If you run your Newair constantly (like I do) you can count on replacing the water holder  (the piece that attaches to the rotary motor pump housing) and water pump every year. Year 1 I replaced the water holder and water pump. Year 2 the water pump went out. I replaced that. Shortly after that I noticed the water holder was cracking again. I was going to try and fix it with Loctite but then the compressor went out. OK, time to replace the entire unit as in total I already spent $90 replacing parts. I decided to get the same one because all of the other brands (except one that got really good ratings but is too big) will have the same problem i.e. cheap plastic parts etc. So I yanked out all the parts from the old one that I can reuse in the replacement.<br /><br />(Prior Post) I updated my review from last year. So a little over a year has gone by. The water hold that holds the water for freezing into cubes cracked down the side where it attaches to the motor. Apparently, this is a common problem. Hopped on Youtube and luckily a guy posted 3 videos on how to fix it. After spending 2 hours wrangling to get the thing out, and waiting for the epoxy to dry, I spent another hour getting it put back together. It started making ice (awesome I thought), then quit. It cracked even worse down the side. So I called today for a replacement part from Newair. $20 plus $9.95 for shipping. What a ripoff for a nothing plastic part.",7/25/15,NEGATIVE

It is not silent, but no louder than a box fan on low, quieter than my dishwasher or dryer that's for sure. Doesn't take up much space, much the same as a toaster, just taller.

I chose the Normal Cotton cycle, three rinse cycles and heavily soiled clothes (as per LG suggestion to get more water).  The load took 2  hours and 4 minutes to complete and after the third rinse cycle, there was still soap foaming in the water.  I had a service technician from Sears come out and check it and he told me that only seeing a few cups of water in the bottom of the drum was normal.  Most of the water sprays into the clothes.  In an attempt to be &#34;efficient&#34; and use less water, I think the front loaders have gone to far.  There simply must be sufficient water to actually rinse the clothes.  The rinse cycle spends a great deal of time flipping the clothes around and doing nothing.  I have even tried adding another rinse and spin cycle for rinse number 4 to get the soap out.  I simply don't have the time to spend over 2 hours on one load of clothes.  Other than that, the wash cycle is great, and the spin cycle extracts water very well.  It is a quiet machine and is easy to use.  I like the drain hose at the base of the machine that lets you eliminate water from the pan to avoid that mildew smell.  I would rather have more water in one good rinse cycle than have to rinse clothes 3-4 times thus using far more water.",7/24/15,POSITIVE

So far the unit has met my expectations. First off, it looks fabulous sitting on the counter. Secondly, it's not noisy.  I was concerned it might be too loud sitting in our kitchen since the living room is next door.  I can barely hear it. It's about on par with the noise of a refrigerator and MUCH more quiet than our dishwasher.  The ice is perfectly clear.  I've been dumping it into a Rubbermaid container that I bought just to fit my freezer. It goes in a bit on the wet side, but completes freezing in the freezer and separates nicely when you twist the container a bit.  On the negative: There's a procedure you can activate to have the unit run three minutes longer for thicker ice.  You turn the unit off, then hold the pwr button for 5 seconds to activate. This would be more intuitive with a separate &#34;thick ice&#34; button.  The current method gives no indication of which mode is active.",7/24/15,NEGATIVE

Capacity, in White",Major Appliances,2,41,52,N,N,Bubbles bubble everywhere,"I wanted to love this washer after a bad experience with an HE top-loader, but I had to return it due to a back-up of soap bubbles pouring out of the washer hose where it meets the wall (the standpipe) every time I used the machine (see the pic below). Every time I did a load of laundry, a trail of bubbles would leak out of the standpipe and drip onto our wall and behind the machine, causing potential moisture/mold issues. Luckily the retailer agreed to take it back.<br /><br />I called Speed Queen's technical support numerous times and while they were polite and clearly familiar with the problem, they couldn't do anything to fix it. I tried reducing the amount of detergent, trying different types of HE detergent (though this is a traditional agitator-style machine it requires HE detergent), adding a standpipe adapter, but nothing worked. Speed Queen politely insisted the problem must be my plumbing or the location of the standpipe, but out of the 4 washers that have been installed in the exact same set-up in the past 4 months, only the Speed Queen had a bubble problem. Speed Queen said the problem is because their machines (especially the pump) are very powerful, but I don't think that's the case. It seemed to me that bubbles would get trapped in the hose during the rinse/spin cycle, agitate within the house due to some defect until they turned into a lather, and then discharge at the end of the spin cycle in a torrent.<br /><br />Also, though this machine purports to have a best-in-the-business warranty, good luck using that warranty.When I called Speed Queen to see if we could set up a warranty call to see if there was something wrong with our pump or hose, Speed Queen told me to contact the retailer or to look up a local service provider directly. Speed Queen doesn't seem to provide any warranty services, so it is up to your retailer to handle any warranty claims.  In this case, our retailer was going to charge us a $129 service fee if they determined that there was nothing wrong with the machine so we passed on that.<br /><br />Another quirk of this machine is that the Eco Normal cycle uses no hot water even if the machine is set to warm or hot. All Normal washes are cold water only. If you want a warm or hot wash, you have to use the Permanent Press, Delicate or Heavy Duty cycles. Eco Normal also provides no extra rinse option.<br /><br />Luckily our retailer took this back, or else we would have a big problem with the overflowing bubbles.

First off, once you press &#34;start&#34; you can forget any changes to water temp., load size, numbers of rinse cycles, etc. There is no soak feature. I solved this by filling up the machine, putting in the clothes, giving it 2 minutes washing, then I unplug it and soak for a while. The absolute worst feature is the locked lid. Once the cycle begins the lid is locked, and you have to press &#34;pause&#34; and hold for three seconds, which allows you to open the lid if you want to add soap or more clothes, etc. The ABSOLUTE worst feature is the locked lid. If you should leave the lid open and tub has filled with water, the machine automatically drains the water. What a WASTE of water. I finally disabled the catch on the lid that locks it. Now I run the machine while never closing the lid. I have to remember to reinsert the clip so the machine will reset at the end of the cycle. I'd love to have my old Maytag back that I bought in '93. I could do anything with that tank. When this new Whirlpool machine was delivered, the truck driver carried the new machine into the garage without any assistance or handtruck.
